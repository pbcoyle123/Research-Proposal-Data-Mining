Target Corporation Reports Second Quarter Earnings

• The Company's second quarter operating income margin rate of 4.8 percent was more
than 3 percentage points higher than last year, driven by a higher gross margin rate.
• Second quarter GAAP and Adjusted EPS  of $1.80 was more than 4 times higher than a

1

year ago and above the high end of the Company's guidance range, reﬂecting a
meaningful proﬁt recovery from last year’s inventory actions.

• Second quarter comparable sales declined 5.4 percent.

◦ Continued growth in frequency businesses (Essentials & Beauty and Food &

Beverage) partially oﬀset declines in discretionary categories.

◦ Same-day services grew nearly 4 percent, led by nearly 7 percent growth in Drive-

Up.

• Inventory at the end of Q2 was 17 percent lower than last year, reﬂecting a 25 percent

reduction in discretionary categories, partially oﬀset by inventory investments to support
frequency categories, and strategic investments to support long-term market-share
opportunities.

• Given recent sales trends, the Company lowered its full year sales and proﬁt

expectations. The Company now expects comparable sales in a wide range around a mid-
single digit decline for the remainder of the year, and now expects full-year GAAP and
Adjusted EPS of $7.00 to $8.00.

MINNEAPOLIS (August 16, 2023) – Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today announced its

second quarter 2023 ﬁnancial results, which reﬂected stronger-than-expected proﬁt

performance on softer-than-expected sales.

The Company reported second quarter GAAP and Adjusted earnings per share  (EPS) of $1.80,

1

up 357.6 percent from $0.39 in 2022. The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP

to GAAP measures. All earnings per share ﬁgures refer to diluted EPS.

Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information
about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.

Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation, said “Our second quarter ﬁnancial

results clearly demonstrate the agility of our team and the resilience of our business model, as

we saw better-than-expected proﬁtability in the face of softer-than-expected sales. With the

beneﬁt of a much-leaner inventory position than a year ago, the team was able to quickly

respond to rapidly-changing topline trends throughout the second quarter, while continuing to

focus on the guest experience.”

“As we move into the Fall, the team is gearing up for the biggest seasons of the year, with a

focus on continuing to serve our guests with newness throughout our assortment. At the same

time, we continue to take a cautious approach to planning our business, and have therefore

adjusted our ﬁnancial guidance in anticipation of continued near-term challenges on the topline.

This approach, along with the long-term investments we’re making in our business and strategy,

position us to deliver sustainable, proﬁtable growth in the years ahead.”

Guidance

Given recent sales trends, Target now expects comparable sales in a wide range around a mid-

single digit decline for the remainder of the year. The Company now expects full-year GAAP and

Adjusted EPS of $7.00 to $8.00, compared with the prior range of $7.75 to $8.75.

For the third quarter, the Company expects comparable sales in a wide range around a mid-single

digit decline, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.60.

Operating Results

Comparable sales declined 5.4 percent in the second quarter, reﬂecting comparable store sales

declines of 4.3 percent and comparable digital sales declines of 10.5 percent. Total revenue of

$24.8 billion was 4.9 percent lower than last year, reﬂecting a total sales decline of 4.9 percent

partially oﬀset by a 1.3 percent increase in other revenue. Second quarter operating income of

$1.2 billion was 273.0 percent higher than last year, driven by a higher gross margin rate.

– more –

Target Corporation Reports Second Quarter Earnings — Page 3 of 12

Second quarter operating income margin rate was 4.8 percent in 2023, compared with 1.2

percent in 2022. Second quarter gross margin rate was 27.0 percent, compared with 21.5

percent in 2022, reﬂecting lower markdowns and other inventory-related costs, lower freight

costs, retail price increases, and lower supply chain and digital fulﬁllment costs. These beneﬁts

were partially oﬀset by higher inventory shrink. Second quarter SG&A expense rate was 20.9

percent in 2023, compared with 19.2 percent in 2022, reﬂecting the de-leveraging impact of

lower sales combined with higher costs, including continued investments in pay and beneﬁts

and inﬂationary pressures throughout our business, partially oﬀset by disciplined cost

management.

Interest Expense and Taxes

The Company’s second quarter 2023 net interest expense was $141 million, compared with

$112 million last year, reﬂecting higher average long-term debt balances combined with the

impact of higher ﬂoating interest rates.

Second quarter 2023 eﬀective income tax rate was 22.2 percent, compared with the prior year

rate of 15.8 percent. The rate increase was driven by higher earnings, which diluted the beneﬁt

of ﬁxed and discrete tax items.

Capital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital

The Company paid dividends of $499 million in the second quarter, compared with $417 million

last year, primarily driven by a 20.0 percent increase in the dividend per share.

The Company did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter. As of the end of the quarter,

the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase

program approved by Target’s Board of Directors in August 2021.

– more –

Target Corporation Reports Second Quarter Earnings — Page 4 of 12

For the trailing twelve months through second quarter 2023, after-tax return on invested capital

(ROIC) was 13.7 percent, compared with 18.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through

second quarter 2022. The decrease in ROIC was driven primarily by lower proﬁtability coupled

with an increase in invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information

about the Company’s ROIC calculation.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To  provide  additional  transparency,  we  have  disclosed  non-GAAP  adjusted  diluted  earnings  per  share  (Adjusted
EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-
to-period comparisons of the results of our operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to,
GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may
calculate Adjusted EPS diﬀerently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Third quarter and full-year 2023 GAAP EPS may include the impact of certain discrete items, which will be
excluded in calculating Adjusted EPS. In the past, these items have included losses on the early retirement
of  debt  and  certain  other  items  that  are  discretely  managed.  The  Company  is  not  currently  aware  of  any
such discrete items.

Earnings  before  interest  expense  and  income  taxes  (EBIT)  and  earnings  before  interest  expense,  income  taxes,
depreciation  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  are  non-GAAP  ﬁnancial  measures.  We  believe  these  measures  provide
meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of
diﬀerences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and, for EBITDA, capital investment. These measures are
not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings. EBIT and
EBITDA  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a  substitution  for  analysis  of  our  results  as  reported  in
accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate EBIT and EBITDA diﬀerently, limiting the usefulness of the
measures for comparisons with other companies.

We have also disclosed after-tax ROIC, which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of the add-
back of operating lease interest to operating income. We believe this metric is useful in assessing the eﬀectiveness
of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC diﬀerently, limiting the usefulness of the
measure for comparisons with other companies.

Represents the add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if
the  property  under  our  operating  leases  were  owned  or  accounted  for  as  ﬁnance  leases.  Calculated  using
the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense within SG&A. Operating lease
interest  is  added  back  to  Operating  Income  in  the  ROIC  calculation  to  control  for  diﬀerences  in  capital
structure between us and our competitors.
Calculated  using  the  eﬀective  tax  rates,  which  were  20.2  percent  and  21.7  percent  for  the  trailing  twelve
months  ended  July  29,  2023,  and  July  30,  2022,  respectively.  For  the  twelve  months  ended  July  29,  2023,
and  July  30,  2022,  includes  tax  eﬀect  of  $1.0  billion  and  $1.3  billion,  respectively,  related  to  EBIT,  and
$20 million and $19 million, respectively, related to operating lease interest.
Total  short-term  and  long-term  operating  lease  liabilities  included  within  Accrued  and  Other  Current
Liabilities and Noncurrent Operating Lease Liabilities, respectively.
Average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of
the comparable prior period.
