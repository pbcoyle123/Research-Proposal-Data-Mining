Company, eﬀective as of the close of business January 31, 2024 (the “Retirement Date”). Beginning on September
11, 2023, Ms. McKenna will transition out of the role of Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive
Oﬃcer, Walmart International, and will serve as an Executive Vice President of the Company in a transitional role
reporting to the Company’s President and Chief Executive Oﬃcer through the Retirement Date, at which time her
employment with the Company will end. Ms. McKenna has served as Executive Vice President, President and Chief
Executive Oﬃcer, Walmart International since February 2018. Previously, Ms. McKenna served in a variety of roles
since joining the Company in 1996, including Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Oﬃcer of Walmart U.S.,
Executive Vice President and Chief Development Oﬃcer of Walmart U.S., Executive Vice President, Strategy and
International Development for Walmart International, and Chief Operating Oﬃcer of Asda Group Limited, the
Company’s former subsidiary in the United Kingdom.

In connection with her notice of intent to retire, on August 16, 2023, the Company and Ms. McKenna entered into a
Retirement Agreement (the “Agreement”). Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement,
Ms. McKenna will receive payments totaling $2,300,000 to be paid over a two-year period following the Retirement

unvested equity awards. The Agreement also prohibits Ms. McKenna, for a period of two years following the
