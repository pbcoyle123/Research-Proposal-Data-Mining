BENTONVILLE, Ark., Aug 17, 2023 – Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT)

• Consolidated gross margin rate up 50bps on lapping
elevated markdowns and supply chain costs, partially
oﬀset by ongoing mix pressure in grocery and health &
wellness

• Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net

sales grew 33bps

“ We had another strong quarter. Around the world, our

customers and members are prioritizing value and
convenience. They’re shopping with us across channels —
in stores, Sam’s Clubs, and they’re driving eCommerce,
which was up 24% globally. Food is a strength, but we’re
also encouraged by our results in general merchandise
versus our expectations when we started the quarter. Our
associates helped deliver increases in transaction counts
and units sold, and proﬁt is growing faster than sales.
We’re in good shape with inventory, and we like our
position for the back half of the year.”

Guidance

The following guidance reﬂects the Company’s expectations for the third quarter and ﬁscal year 2024 and is provided on a non-
GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, such as the changes in
fair value of the Company’s equity and other investments. Growth rates reﬂect an adjusted basis for prior year results.
Additionally, the Company’s guidance assumes a generally stable consumer and continued pressure from its mix of products and
formats globally. The Company’s ﬁscal year guidance is based on the following previously disclosed FY23 ﬁgures: Net sales: $605.9
billion, adjusted operating income : $24.6 billion, and adjusted EPS : $6.29.

Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, and it is important to
review in conjunction with the company’s ﬁnancial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Walmart's deﬁnition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs
open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an
important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in
our industry may calculate comparable sales diﬀerently, limiting the comparability of the metric.

Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial
Measures
(Unaudited)

The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most
directly comparable ﬁnancial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-
GAAP ﬁnancial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the
ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures should not be considered
superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP
ﬁnancial measures in the press release may diﬀer from similar measures used by other companies.

Constant Currency
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the eﬀect of changes in currency exchange rates as the diﬀerence between current period activity
translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate
ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.

Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating
results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors
to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations.

The table below reﬂects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023.

Adjusted operating income

Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges included in operating income calculated in
accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the
performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, adjusted operating income aﬀords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings
performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the prior year.

When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The
disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate
ﬂuctuations. The table below reﬂect the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency for the three months and three and six

Free Cash Flow

We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by
operating activities was $18.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $9.0 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year.
The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free cash ﬂow for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was $9.0
billion, which represents an increase of $7.2 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating cash
ﬂows described above, partially oﬀset by an increase of $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.

Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from
our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be considered in addition to,
rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Additionally, Walmart’s deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the
measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is
important to view free cash ﬂow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Although other companies report their free cash ﬂow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash ﬂow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s
management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash ﬂow.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow, a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP
ﬁnancial measure most directly comparable to free cash ﬂow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in ﬁnancing activities.

Adjusted EPS

Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain
amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure
calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the
performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS aﬀords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and
the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year.

We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the
company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments.
Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the realized
and unrealized gains and losses related to those equity investments.

We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023 by adjusting EPS for the following:

1.

unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity and other investments; and

Return on Investment

We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as well as Return on Investment ("ROI") as
measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how eﬀectively Walmart is
deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be
the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of ROI.

ROA was 5.6 percent and 5.8 percent for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in
average total assets driven by higher purchases of property and equipment. ROI was 12.8 percent and 13.8 percent for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The decrease in ROI was the result of a decrease in operating income primarily due to opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded
in Q3 and Q4 of ﬁscal 2023 respectively, as well as an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment.

We deﬁne ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital
during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average
amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.

Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure because we calculate ROI using ﬁnancial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and
excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP ﬁnancial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income
in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI diﬀers from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets
for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated
depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more
accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods
exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate
their ROI.

The following guidance reﬂects the Company’s expectations for the third quarter and ﬁscal year 2024 and is provided on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, such as the changes in fair value of the Company’s equity and other investments. Growth rates reﬂect an adjusted basis for prior year results. Additionally, the Company’s guidance assumes a generally stable consumer and continued pressure from its mix of products and formats globally. The Company’s ﬁscal year guidance is based on the following previously disclosed FY23 ﬁgures: Net sales: $605.9 billion, adjusted operating income1: $24.6 billion, adjusted EPS1 $6.29.

Non-GAAP measures - ROI We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as well as Return on Investment ("ROI") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how eﬀectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 5.6% percent and 5.8% percent for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in average total assets driven by higher purchases of property and equipment. ROI was 12.8% and 13.8% for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROI was the result of a decrease in operating income primarily due to opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded in Q3 and Q4 of ﬁscal 2023 respectively, as well as an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We deﬁne ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable a

example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI diﬀers from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Non-GAAP measures – free cash ﬂow We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $9.0 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free cash ﬂow for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was $9.0 billion, which represents an increase of $7.2 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating cash ﬂows described above, partially oﬀset by an increase of $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash ﬂow as a m

Non-GAAP measures – constant currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the eﬀect of changes in currency exchange rates as the diﬀerence between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The table below reﬂects the calculation of constant currency for net sales for the Walmart International segment for the trailing ﬁve quarters and operating income for the current quarter.

Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS aﬀords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the trailing ﬁve quarters as well as the prior year comparable periods by adjusting EPS for the relevant adjustments for each period presented.

Non-GAAP measures - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We include net income and net income margin, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principle as well as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to provide meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of certain items. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We also exclude other gains and losses, which is primarily comprised of fair value adjustments on our investments which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. From time to time, we will also adjust certain items from operating income, which we believe is meaningful because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are considered non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures. Management believes, however, that these measures provide meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency by excluding the impact of diﬀerences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, capital investments and other items which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. We consider net income to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled measures. Net income margin was 4.9% and 3.4% for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net income margin was primarily due to the increase in net income, which was impacted by higher unrealized net gains on our equity and other investments, when compared to the same period in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 6.4% and 6.3% for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was due to higher operating income driven primarily by an increase in net sales when compared to the same period in the previous year.

 
Non-GAAP measures – Adjusted EBITDA & Adjusted EBITDA margin The calculation of net income margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin, along with a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin to the calculation of net income margin, is as follows: We deﬁne adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as adjustments for certain items that are excluded from earnings as previously described in the reconciliation for adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that this measure provides meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of diﬀerences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, capital investments and other items which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance.
