Additional Highlights:

•

Total comparable club sales decreased by 5.3% in the second quarter of ﬁscal 2023 compared to the second
quarter of ﬁscal 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline sales, comparable club sales increased by 1.1% in
the second quarter of ﬁscal 2023 compared to the same period in ﬁscal 2022. Total comparable club sales
decreased  by  1.9%  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Excluding  the
impact of gasoline sales, comparable club sales increased by 3.3% in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2023 compared
to the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2022.

• Gross  proﬁt  increased  to  $896.8  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023  from  $860.0  million  in  the
second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Merchandise  gross  margin  rate,  which  excludes  gasoline  sales  and
membership  fee  income,  increased  by  90  basis  points  over  the  same  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Gross  proﬁt
increased  to  $1,776.8  million  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023  from  $1,651.2  million  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal
2022.  Merchandise  gross  margin  rate  increased  by  100  basis  points  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023.
Merchandise margins were positively impacted by disinﬂation, moderated supply chain costs and improved
inventory management for both comparative periods.

•

•

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased to $695.0 million in the second quarter of
ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  $651.2  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  SG&A  increased  to  $1,384.3
million  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  $1,287.2  million  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2022.  The
increase  in  both  comparative  periods  was  primarily  driven  by  increased  labor  and  occupancy  costs  as  a
result of new club and gas station openings in addition to other investments to drive strategic priorities.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased to $184.0 million in the second quarter
of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  $192.0  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Income  from  continuing
operations  before  income  taxes  increased  to  $356.1  million  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to
$334.5 million in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2022.

The  eﬀective  tax  rate  increased  to  28.6%  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  26.6%  in  the
second quarter of ﬁscal 2022. Income tax expense increased to $52.7 million in the second quarter of ﬁscal
2023  compared  to  $51.0  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  The  eﬀective  tax  rate  increased  to
30.5% in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2023 compared to 24.2% in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2022. Income tax expense
increased to $108.8 million in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $81.0 million in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal
2022. Lower excess tax beneﬁts from stock-based compensation and lower tax credits resulted in increases
in  the  eﬀective  tax  rates  for  the  second  quarter  and  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023.  The  eﬀective  tax  rate  for  the
ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2023 was also impacted by an immaterial adjustment to certain deferred tax assets related
to prior periods.

• Net income decreased to $131.3 million in the second quarter of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $141.0 million in
the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Net  income  decreased  to  $247.4  million  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023
compared to $253.5 million in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2022.

•

Adjusted  EBITDA  decreased  by  1.8%  to  $268.8  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to
$273.7 million in the second quarter of ﬁscal 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6.3% to $525.7 million in
the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $494.5 million in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2022.

• Under its existing share repurchase program, the Company repurchased 715,122 shares of common stock,
totaling  $44.6  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023.  In  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  2023,  the  Company
repurchased 919,162 shares of common stock, totaling $59.9 million, under such program.

Fiscal 2023 Ending February 3, 2024 Outlook

“As  we  look  ahead,  we  remain  conﬁdent  in  our  ability  to  maintain  the  momentum  in  our  traﬃc  and  market  share
gains  due  to  our  unrelenting  focus  on  value.  However,  we  also  continue  to  navigate  shifts  in  consumer  behavior
driven by the broader macroeconomic environment. As a result, we are reﬁning our outlook for the rest of the ﬁscal
year,” said Laura Felice, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Oﬃcer, BJ's Wholesale Club. “For ﬁscal 2023, we
expect our comparable club sales, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, to increase approximately 2% year-over-
year.  We  expect  our  ﬁscal  2023  membership  fee  income  to  increase  approximately  5%  year-over-year  and
merchandise  gross  margins  to  improve  by  approximately  50  basis  points  year-over-year.  Finally,  we  expect  ﬁscal
2023 GAAP and adjusted EPS to be in the $3.80 to $3.92 range.”

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information

This press release includes ﬁnancial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted
net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, free cash ﬂow, net debt and net debt to last
twelve months (“LTM”) adjusted EBITDA.

We  deﬁne  adjusted  net  income  as  net  income  attributable  to  common  stockholders  adjusted  for:  acquisition  and
integration  costs;  home  oﬃce  transition  costs;  charges  related  to  debt  payments;  other  adjustments  and  the  tax
impact of the foregoing adjustments on net income.

We deﬁne adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted
shares outstanding.

We deﬁne adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before interest expense, net, provision for income
taxes  and  depreciation  and  amortization,  adjusted  for  the  impact  of  certain  other  items,  including:  stock-based
compensation  expense;  pre-opening  expenses;  non-cash  rent;  acquisition  and  integration  costs  and  other
adjustments.

We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property and equipment, net
of disposals, plus proceeds from sale leaseback transactions.

We deﬁne net debt as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents.

We deﬁne net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA as net debt at the balance sheet date divided by adjusted EBITDA for
the trailing twelve-month period.

We  present  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share  and  adjusted  EBITDA,  which  are  not
recognized  ﬁnancial  measures  under  GAAP,  because  we  believe  such  measures  assist  investors  and  analysts  in
comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do
not  believe  are  indicative  of  our  core  operating  performance.  In  addition,  adjusted  EBITDA  excludes  pre-opening
expenses, because we do not believe these expenses are indicative of the underlying operating performance of our
clubs.  The  amount  and  timing  of  pre-opening  expenses  are  dependent  on,  among  other  things,  the  size  of  new
clubs opened and the number of new clubs opened during any given period.

Management  believes  that  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share  and  adjusted  EBITDA  are
helpful  in  highlighting  trends  in  our  core  operating  performance  compared  to  other  measures,  which  can  diﬀer
signiﬁcantly  depending  on  long-term  strategic  decisions  regarding  capital  structure,  the  tax  jurisdictions  in  which
companies  operate  and  capital  investments.  We  use  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share
and  adjusted  EBITDA  to  supplement  GAAP  measures  of  performance  in  the  evaluation  of  the  eﬀectiveness  of  our
business  strategies;  to  make  budgeting  decisions;  and  to  compare  our  performance  against  that  of  other  peer
companies  using  similar  measures.  We  also  use  adjusted  EBITDA  in  connection  with  establishing  discretionary
annual incentive compensation.

We present free cash ﬂow, which is not a recognized ﬁnancial measure under GAAP, because we use it to report to
our  Board  of  Directors  and  we  believe  it  assists  investors  and  analysts  in  evaluating  our  liquidity.  Free  cash  ﬂow
should  not  be  considered  as  an  alternative  to  cash  ﬂows  from  operations  as  a  liquidity  measure.  We  present  net
debt and net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA, which are not recognized as ﬁnancial measures under GAAP, because
we use them to report to our Board of Directors and we believe they assist investors and analysts in evaluating our
borrowing  capacity.  Net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA  is  a  key  ﬁnancial  measure  that  is  used  by  management  to
assess the borrowing capacity of the Company.

You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental
analysis. In evaluating adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and net debt
to LTM adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or like
some  of  the  adjustments  in  our  presentation  of  these  metrics.  Our  presentation  of  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted
net  income  per  diluted  share,  adjusted  EBITDA,  free  cash  ﬂow,  net  debt  and  net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA
should not be considered as alternatives to any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP and they should
not  be  construed  as  an  inference  that  the  Company’s  future  results  will  be  unaﬀected  by  unusual  or  non-
recurring  items.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  not  modify  the  presentation  of  adjusted  net  income,
adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA or net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA in the

8

.

future,  and  any  such  modiﬁcation  may  be  material.  In  addition,  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per
diluted  share,  adjusted  EBITDA,  free  cash  ﬂow,  net  debt  and  net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA  may  not  be
comparable  to  similarly  titled  measures  used  by  other  companies  in  our  industry  or  across  diﬀerent  industries.
Additionally, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, free cash ﬂow, net debt
and  net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA  have  limitations  as  analytical  tools,  and  you  should  not  consider  them  in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
