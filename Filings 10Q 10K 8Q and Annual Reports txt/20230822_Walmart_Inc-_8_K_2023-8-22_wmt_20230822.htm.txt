Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

During  ﬁscal  2023,  Walmart  Inc.  (the  “Company”)  accrued  a  liability  for  approximately  $3.3  billion  for  the
Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements to resolve
substantially  all  opioids-related  lawsuits  ﬁled  against  the  Company,  as  well  as  all  potential  claims  that  could  be
made against the Company, by states and political subdivisions (the “State Settlement Framework”) and tribes (the
“Tribal  Settlement  Framework”).  Both  the  State  Settlement  Framework  and  the  Tribal  Settlement  Framework  are
referred to collectively as the "Settlement Framework."

On August 22, 2023, a settlement administrator determined that a suﬃcient number of political subdivisions
have  agreed  to  participate  in  the  State  Settlement  Framework.  Therefore,  the  State  Settlement  Framework  will
become eﬀective on September 6, 2023, and the Company will pay the remaining approximately $2.8 billion of the
original approximately $3.3 billion accrued liability in the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2024. Although the settlement
administrator  has  determined  a  suﬃcient  number  of  political  subdivisions  have  agreed  to  participate  in  the  State
Settlement  Framework,  and  thus  the  State  Settlement  Framework  will  become  eﬀective,  eligible  political
subdivisions still have until July 15, 2025 to join the State Settlement Framework.

In  accordance  with  General  Instruction  B.2  of  Form  8-K,  the  information  in  this  Current  Report  shall  not  be
deemed  "ﬁled"  for  purposes  of  Section  18  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  "Exchange
Act"),  or  otherwise  be  subject  to  the  liability  of  that  section  and  shall  not  be  incorporated  by  reference  into  any
ﬁling or other document ﬁled under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be
expressly set forth by speciﬁc reference in such ﬁling or document.
