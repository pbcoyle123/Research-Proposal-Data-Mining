NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Description of Business

BJ’s  Wholesale  Club  Holdings,  Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  is  a  leading  warehouse  club  operator
concentrated  primarily  in  the  eastern  half  of  the  United  States.  As  of  July  29,  2023,  the  Company
operated 238 warehouse clubs and 168 gas stations in 19 states.

The Company follows and reports based on the National Retail Federation’s ﬁscal calendar. The thirteen-week
periods ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022 are referred to herein as the "second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023" and
the "second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022," respectively.

2. Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying interim ﬁnancial statements of BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. are unaudited and, in the
opinion of management, reﬂect all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the
Company’s ﬁnancial statements in accordance with GAAP. 

The  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  January  28,  2023  is  derived  from  the  audited  consolidated
balance  sheet  as  of  that  date.  The  unaudited  results  of  operations  for  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal
year  2023  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  future  results  or  results  to  be  expected  for  ﬁscal  year  2023.  The
Company’s  business,  in  common  with  the  business  of  retailers  generally,  is  subject  to  seasonal  inﬂuences.  The
Company’s sales and operating income have typically been highest in the fourth quarter holiday season and lowest
in the ﬁrst quarter of each ﬁscal year. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated ﬁnancial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal
year 2022, as ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2023.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Policies

The  Company’s  accounting  policies  are  set  forth  in  the  audited  ﬁnancial  statements  included  in  the
Company’s  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  ﬁscal  year  2022.  There  have  been  no  material  changes  to  these
accounting  policies  and  no  accounting  pronouncements  adopted  that  had  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s
ﬁnancial statements.

3. Revenue Recognition

Performance Obligations

The  Company  identiﬁes  each  distinct  performance  obligation  to  transfer  goods  (or  bundle  of  goods)  or
services.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  as  it  satisﬁes  a  performance  obligation  by  transferring  control  of  the
goods or services to the customer.

Net sales—The Company recognizes net sales at clubs and gas stations when the customer takes possession
of the goods and tenders payment. Sales tax is recorded as a liability at the point of sale. Revenue is recorded at
the  point  of  sale  based  on  the  transaction  price  on  the  shelf  sign,  net  of  any  applicable  discounts,  sales  tax  and
expected  refunds.  For  e-commerce  sales,  the  Company  recognizes  sales  when  control  of  the  merchandise  is
transferred  to  the  customer,  which  is  typically  at  the  time  of  shipment.  The  following  table  summarizes  the
Company’s  point  of  sale  transactions  at  clubs  and  gas  stations,  excluding  sales  tax,  as  a  percentage  of  both  net
sales and total revenues:

BJ’s  Perks  Rewards  and  My  BJ’s  Perks  programs—The  Company’s  BJ’s  Perks  Rewards  membership  program
which  was  in  place  in  ﬁscal  year  2022  and  the  ﬁrst  month  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  allowed  participating  members  to
earn  2%  cash  back,  up  to  a  maximum  of  $500  per  year,  on  qualiﬁed  purchases  made  at  BJ’s.  The  Company  also
oﬀered a co-branded credit card program, the My BJ’s Perks program, which allowed My BJ’s Perks Mastercard credit
card  holders  to  earn  up  to  a  10  cent-per-gallon  discount  on  gasoline,  up  to  5%  cash  back  on  eligible  purchases
made at BJ’s and up to 2% cash back on purchases made with the card outside of BJ’s. Cash back was in the form of
electronic  awards  issued  in  $10  increments  that  could  be  used  online  or  in-club  at  the  register  and  expired  six
months from the date issued. 

In  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  the  Company  rebranded  the  rewards  program.  The  former  BJ's  Perks
Rewards membership program is now the Club+ program, whereby participating members earn 2% cash back, up
to  a  maximum  of  $500  per  year,  on  qualiﬁed  purchases  made  at  BJs  and  a  5  cent-per-gallon  discount  at  BJ's  gas
locations.  Cash  back  is  in  the  form  of  electronic  awards  issued  to  each  member  once  $10  in  rewards  have  been
earned. The Company's co-branded credit card program is now the BJ's One and BJ's One+ program, which allows
cardholders with the opportunity to earn up to 5% cash back on purchases made in BJ's clubs or online at bjs.com
and up to a 15 cent-per-gallon discount on gasoline when paying with a BJ's One or BJ's One+ Mastercard at our BJ’s
gas  locations.  Cash  back  is  in  the  form  of  electronic  awards  issued  to  each  member  monthly  on  their  credit  card
statement date. Earned rewards under these two programs do not expire.

The Company accounts for these transactions as multiple element arrangements and allocates the transaction
price  to  separate  performance  obligations  using  their  relative  fair  values.  The  Company  includes  the  fair  value  of
award dollars earned in deferred revenue at the time the award dollars are earned. This liability was $43.1 million
at  July  29,  2023,  $34.7  million  at  January  28,  2023,  and  $40.0  million  at  July  30,  2022  and  is  included  in  accrued
expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  in  the  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Earned  awards  may  be
redeemed on future purchases made at the Company. The Company recognizes revenue for earned awards when
customers redeem such awards as part of a purchase at one of the Company’s clubs or on the Company’s website
or mobile app. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, the Company recognized $34.7 million of revenue
that was included in the deferred liability as of January 28, 2023. The Company expects to recognize $43.1 million
of deferred revenue during the remainder of ﬁscal year 2023. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2022, the
Company recognized $30.3 million that was included in the deferred liability as of January 29, 2022.

The Company’s total deferred royalty revenue related to the outstanding My BJ's Perks and BJ's One and BJ's
One+  credit  card  program  was  $5.6  million,  $17.9  million,  and  $28.5  million  at  July  29,  2023,  January  28,
2023,  and  July  30,  2022,  respectively,  and  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  in  the
condensed  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  timing  of  revenue  recognition  of  these  awards  is  driven  by  actual
customer activities, such as reward redemptions and expirations. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023,
the Company recognized $17.9 million of revenue that was included in the deferred liability as of January 28, 2023.
As  of  July  29,  2023,  the  Company  expects  to  recognize  $5.6  million  of  deferred  revenue  during  the  remainder  of
ﬁscal year 2023.

In  connection  with  the  new  co-brand  credit  card  program,  the  Company  had  deferred  revenue  of
approximately $11.9 million and $18.9 million for funds received related to marketing and other integration costs
as  of  July  29,  2023  and  January  28,  2023,  respectively.  During  the  twenty-six  weeks  ended  July  29,  2023,  the
Company  recognized  $5.0  million  of  revenue  that  was  included  in  the  deferred  liability  as  of  January  28,  2023,
related  to  these  marketing  and  other  integration  costs.  The  Company  expects  to  recognize  approximately  $2.1
million  of  deferred  revenue  during  the  remainder  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  which  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and
other  current  liabilities.  The  Company  expects  to  recognize  approximately  $9.8  million  thereafter,  of  which  $2.6
million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $7.2 million is included in other non-current
liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Membership—The  Company  charges  a  membership  fee  to  its  customers,  which  allows  customers  to  shop  in
the Company’s clubs, shop on the Company’s website, and purchase gasoline at the Company’s gas stations for the
duration of the membership, which is generally 12 months. As the Company has the obligation to provide access to
its clubs, website, and gas stations for the duration of the membership term, the Company recognizes membership
fees  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  life  of  the  membership.  The  Company’s  deferred  revenue  related  to
membership fees was $195.3 million, $183.7 million, and

11

$185.4  million  at  July  29,  2023,  January  28,  2023,  and  July  30,  2022,  respectively,  and  is  included  in  accrued
expenses and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Gift  Card  Programs—The  Company  sells  BJ’s  gift  cards  that  allow  customers  to  redeem  the  card  for  future
purchases equal to the amount of the face value of the gift card. Revenue from gift card sales is recognized upon
redemption of the gift card because the Company’s performance obligation to redeem the gift card for merchandise
is satisﬁed when the gift card is redeemed. Deferred revenue related to gift cards was $13.4 million, $14.1 million,
and  $11.9  million  at  July  29,  2023,  January  28,  2023,  and  July  30,  2022,  respectively.  The  Company
recognized  $10.9  million  and  $12.7  million  of  revenue  from  gift  card  redemptions  in  the  second  quarters  of  ﬁscal
years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recognized $22.5 million and $23.2 million of revenue from gift
card redemptions in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively.

Disaggregation of Revenue

The Company’s club retail operations, which include retail club and other sales procured from our clubs and
distribution  centers,  represent  substantially  all  of  its  consolidated  total  revenues,  and  are  the  Company’s  only
reportable  segment.  All  the  Company’s  identiﬁable  assets  are  in  the  United  States.  The  Company  does  not  have
signiﬁcant sales outside the United States, nor does any customer represent more than 10% of total revenues for
any period presented.

On July 28, 2022, the Company entered into the ABL Revolving Facility with an ABL Revolving Commitment of
$1.2  billion  pursuant  to  that  certain  credit  agreement  (the  "Credit  Agreement")  with  Bank  of  America,  N.A.,  as
administrative  agent  and  collateral  agent,  and  the  other  lenders  party  thereto.  The  maturity  date  of  the  ABL
Revolving  Facility  is  July  28,  2027.  In  connection  with  this  transaction,  the  Company  extinguished  the  previous
senior secured asset based revolving credit and term facility.

Revolving loans under the ABL Revolving Facility are available in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of
the aggregate ABL Revolving Commitment or a borrowing base based on the value of certain inventory, accounts
and credit card receivables, subject to speciﬁed advance rebates and reserves as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Indebtedness under the ABL Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets (other than real estate) of
the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries,  subject  to  customary  exceptions.  As  amended,  interest  on  the  ABL  Revolving
Facility  is  calculated  either  at  the  SOFR  plus  a  range  of  100  to  125  basis  points  or  a  base  rate  plus  0  to  25  basis
points, based on excess availability. The Company will also pay an unused commitment fee of 20 basis points per
annum on the unused ABL Revolving Commitment. Each borrowing is

12

for  a  period  of  one,  three,  or  six  months,  as  selected  by  the  Company,  or  for  such  other  period  that  is  twelve
months or less requested by the Company and consented to by the lenders and administrative agent.

The  ABL  Revolving  Facility  places  certain  restrictions  (i.e.,  covenants)  upon  the  Borrower’s,  and  its
subsidiaries’, ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make certain loans,
investments, and divestitures. The ABL Revolving Facility contains customary events of default (including payment
defaults, cross-defaults to certain of the Company's other indebtedness, breach of representations and covenants
and  change  of  control).  The  occurrence  of  an  event  of  default  under  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  would  permit  the
lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the ABL Revolving Facility.

As of July 29, 2023, there was $411.0 million outstanding in loans under the ABL Revolving Facility and $11.3
million  in  outstanding  letters  of  credit.  The  interest  rate  on  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  was  6.42%  and  unused
capacity was $726.2 million.

First Lien Term Loan

On  January  5,  2023,  the  Company  entered  into  the  Third  Amendment  to  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan  Credit
Agreement,  with  Nomura  Corporate  Funding  Americas,  LLC,  as  administrative  agent  and  collateral  agent  and  the
lenders party thereto. BofA Securities, Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Wells Fargo Securities LLC acted as
joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners of the Third Amendment.

The  Third  Amendment,  among  other  things,  extended  the  maturity  date  with  respect  to  the  term  loans
outstanding  under  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan  Credit  Agreement  from  February  3,  2024  to  February  3,  2027.  In
addition,  the  Third  Amendment  transitioned  the  interest  rate,  immediately,  from  LIBOR  to  SOFR  and  changed  the
applicable margin from LIBOR plus 200 – 225 basis points per annum to SOFR plus 275 basis points per annum.

Voluntary prepayments are permitted. Principal payments must be made on the First Lien Term Loan pursuant
to an annual excess cash ﬂow calculation when the net leverage ratio exceeds 3.50 to 1.00. As of July 29, 2023, the
Company's net leverage ratio did not exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and therefore, no incremental principal payments were
required.  The  First  Lien  Term  Loan  is  subject  to  certain  aﬃrmative  and  negative  covenants  but  no  ﬁnancial
covenants. It is secured on a senior basis by certain "ﬁxed assets" of the Company and on a junior basis by certain
"liquid" assets of the Company.

There was $450.0 million outstanding on the First Lien Term Loan at July 29, 2023 and January 28, 2023, and
$701.9  million  outstanding  at  July  30,  2022.  The  interest  rates  were  7.89%,  7.11%,  and  3.96%  at  July  29,  2023,
January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022, respectively.

5. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail business. In accordance with
applicable  accounting  guidance,  an  accrual  will  be  established  for  legal  proceedings  if  and  when  those  matters
present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. The Company does not believe the resolution of
any current proceedings will result in a material loss to the condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

6. Stock Incentive Plans

On  June  13,  2018,  the  Company’s  board  of  directors  adopted,  and  its  stockholders  approved,  the  BJ’s
Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. 2018 Incentive Award Plan (the "2018 Plan"). The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of
stock  options,  restricted  stock,  dividend  equivalents,  stock  payments,  restricted  stock  units,  performance  shares,
other  incentive  awards,  stock  appreciation  rights,  and  cash  awards.  Prior  to  the  adoption  of  the  2018  Plan,  the
Company granted stock-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors under the Fourth Amended
and  Restated  2011  Stock  Option  Plan  of  BJ’s  Wholesale  Club,  Inc.  (f/k/a  Beacon  Holding  Inc.),  as  amended
(the  "2011  Plan")  and  the  2012  Director  Stock  Option  Plan  of  BJ’s  Wholesale  Club  Holdings,  Inc.  (f/k/a  Beacon
Holding,  Inc.),  as  amended  (the  "2012  Director  Plan").  No  further  grants  will  be  made  under  the  2011  Plan  or
the 2012 Director Plan.

The  2018  Plan  authorizes  the  issuance  of  13,148,058  shares,  including  985,369  shares  that  were  reserved
but not issued under the 2011 Plan and the 2012 Director Plan. If an award under the 2018 Plan, the 2011 Plan, or
the  2012  Director  Plan  is  forfeited,  expires,  or  is  settled  for  cash,  any  shares  subject  to  such  award  may,  to  the
extent of such forfeiture, expiration, or

13

cash  settlement,  be  used  again  for  new  grants  under  the  2018  Plan.  Additionally,  shares  tendered  or  withheld  to
satisfy  grant  or  exercise  price,  or  tax  withholding  obligations  associated  with  an  award  under  the  2018  Plan,
the 2011 Plan, or the 2012 Director Plan will be added to the shares authorized for grant under the 2018 Plan. The
following shares may not be used again for grant under the 2018 Plan: (1) shares subject to a stock appreciation
right ("SAR") that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the SAR upon its exercise and (2) shares
purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options under the 2018 Plan, 2011 Plan,
or  2012  Director  Plan.  As  of  July  29,  2023,  there  were  4,916,649  shares  available  for  future  issuance  under
the 2018 Plan.

(a)     Includes 320 incremental Performance Stock awards granted in ﬁscal year 2020 with a weighted-average
grant date fair value of $24.35, that vested in ﬁscal year 2023 at greater than 100% of target based on
performance.

Stock-based  compensation  expense  was  $9.6  million  and  $9.4  million  for  the  thirteen  weeks  ended  July  29,
2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively, and $19.6 million and $18.5 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29,
2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively.

On June 14, 2018, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the ESPP, which
became  eﬀective  July  1,  2018.  The  aggregate  number  of  shares  of  common  stock  that  were  to  be  reserved  for
issuance  under  the  ESPP  was  to  be  equal  to  the  sum  of  (i)  973,014  shares  and  (ii)  an  annual  increase  on
the ﬁrst day of each calendar year beginning in 2019 and ending in 2028 equal to the lesser of (A) 486,507 shares,
(B) 0.5% of the shares outstanding (on an as converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding ﬁscal
year  and  (C)  such  smaller  number  of  shares  as  determined  by  the  Company's  board  of  directors.  The  amount  of
expense  recognized  related  to  the  ESPP  was  $0.4  million  and  $0.3  million  for  the  thirteen  weeks  ended  July  29,
2023  and  July  30,  2022,  respectively,  and  $0.7  million  and  $0.5  million  for  the  twenty-six  weeks  ended  July  29,
2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively. As of July 29, 2023, there were 2,463,889 shares available for issuance under
the ESPP.

7. Treasury Shares and Share Repurchase Program

Treasury Shares Acquired on Restricted Stock and Performance Stock Awards

The  Company  acquired  3,625  shares  to  satisfy  employees’  tax  withholding  obligations  upon  the  vesting  of
restricted stock awards in the thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023, which was recorded as $0.3 million of treasury
stock.  The  Company  acquired  5,945  shares  to  satisfy  employees'  tax  withholding  obligations  upon  the  vesting  of
restricted stock awards in the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2022, which was recorded as $0.3 million of treasury
stock.

The Company acquired 359,827 shares to satisfy employees’ tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of
restricted stock and performance stock awards in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, which was recorded as
$27.4  million  of  treasury  stock.  The  Company  acquired  235,845  shares  to  satisfy  employees'  tax  withholding
obligations  upon  the  vesting  of  restricted  stock  awards  in  the  twenty-six  weeks  ended  July  30,  2022,  which  was
recorded as $15.9 million of treasury stock.

Share Repurchase Program

On November 16, 2021, the Company's board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2021
Repurchase  Program")  that  allows  the  Company  to  repurchase  up  to  $500.0  million  of  its  outstanding  common

stock from time to time as

14

market conditions warrant. The 2021 Repurchase Program expires in January 2025. The Company initiated the 2021
Repurchase Program to mitigate potentially dilutive eﬀects of stock options and shares of restricted stock granted
by the Company, in addition to enhancing shareholder value.

The Company repurchased 715,122 shares for $44.6 million and 353,000 shares for $22.8 million during the
thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively. The Company repurchased 919,162 shares for
$59.9  million  and  923,506  shares  for  $58.6  million  during  the  twenty-six  weeks  ended  July  29,  2023  and  July  30,
2022, respectively. As of July 29, 2023, $258.8 million remained available to purchase under the 2021 Repurchase
Program.

8. Income Taxes

The Company projects the estimated annual eﬀective tax rate for ﬁscal year 2023 to be 28.3%, excluding the
tax  eﬀect  of  discrete  events,  such  as  excess  tax  beneﬁts  from  stock-based  compensation,  changes  in  tax
legislation, settlements of tax audits and changes in uncertain tax positions, among others.

The  Company’s  eﬀective  income  tax  rate  from  continuing  operations  was  28.6%  and  26.6%  for  the  thirteen
weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in excess tax beneﬁts from
stock-based compensation and tax credits in the current period. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023 and
July 30, 2022, the Company's eﬀective tax rate from continuing operations was and 30.5% and 24.2%, respectively,
and  the  increase  was  primarily  due  to  an  immaterial  adjustment  to  certain  deferred  tax  assets  related  to  prior
periods,  as  well  as  lower  excess  tax  beneﬁts  from  stock-based  compensation  and  lower  tax  credits  in  the  current
period.

The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. federal and various state taxing jurisdictions. The Company’s
tax years from 2018 forward remain open and subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various
state taxing authorities.

On August 16, 2022, the Inﬂation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States. We currently do not

expect the legislation to have a material impact on our ﬁnancial statements.

9. Fair Value Measurements

Certain  assets  and  liabilities  are  required  to  be  carried  at  fair  value  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Fair  value  is
deﬁned as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal  or  most  advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants on the measurement date.

The Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy
requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial
assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classiﬁed and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the
fair value hierarchy, of which the ﬁrst two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 such as quoted market prices
for  markets  that  are  not  active  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  be  corroborated  by  observable
market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are signiﬁcant to the
fair  value  of  the  assets  or  liabilities,  including  certain  pricing  models,  discounted  cash  ﬂow  methodologies  and
similar techniques that use signiﬁcant unobservable inputs.

15

Financial Assets and Liabilities

The  fair  value  of  the  Company's  long-term  debt  is  estimated  based  on  current  market  rates  for  our  speciﬁc
debt  instrument.  Judgment  is  required  to  develop  these  estimates.  As  such,  the  estimated  fair  value  of  long-term
debt is classiﬁed within Level 2, as deﬁned under U.S. GAAP.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

The Company measures certain non-ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, at fair value on

a non-recurring basis.

The Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other ﬁnancial instruments, including cash, accounts
receivable,  and  accounts  payable,  approximate  their  fair  values  due  to  the  short-term  maturities  of  these
instruments.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The  following  discussion  and  analysis  is  intended  to  promote  an  understanding  of  the  results  of  operations
and ﬁnancial condition of the Company and is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with,
our  condensed  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  and  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the related notes thereto in our
Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  ﬁscal  year  2022.  The  following  discussion  may  contain  forward-looking
statements that reﬂect our plans, estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could diﬀer materially from those
discussed  in  the  forward-looking  statements.  Factors  that  could  cause  such  diﬀerences  are  discussed  in  the
sections  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  titled  "Forward-Looking  Statements"  and  in  Part  I.  "Item  1A.  Risk
Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022.

We report on the basis of a 52- or 53-week ﬁscal year, which ends on the Saturday closest to the last day of
January. Accordingly, references herein to "ﬁscal year 2023" relate to the 53 weeks ending February 03, 2024, and
references herein to "ﬁscal year 2022" relate to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. The second quarter of ﬁscal
year  2023  ended  on  July  29,  2023,  and  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2022  ended  on  July  30,  2022,  and  both
include thirteen weeks.

Overview

BJ’s  Wholesale  Club  is  a  leading  warehouse  club  operator  concentrated  primarily  on  the  eastern  half  of  the
United  States.  We  deliver  signiﬁcant  value  to  our  members,  consistently  oﬀering  25%  or  more  savings  on  a
representative  basket  of  manufacturer-branded  groceries  compared  to  traditional  supermarket  competitors.  We
provide  a  curated  assortment  focused  on  perishable  products,  continuously  refreshed  general  merchandise,
gasoline and other ancillary services, coupon books, and promotions to deliver a diﬀerentiated shopping experience
that is further enhanced by our digital capabilities.

Since  pioneering  the  warehouse  club  model  in  New  England  in  1984,  we  have  grown  our  footprint  to
238  large-format,  high  volume  warehouse  clubs  and  168  gas  stations  spanning  19  states  as  of  the  date  of  this
ﬁling. In our core New England markets, which have high population density and generate a disproportionate part
of U.S. gross domestic product, we operate almost three times the number of clubs compared to the next largest
warehouse  club  competitor.  In  addition  to  shopping  in  our  clubs,  members  are  able  to  shop  when  and  how  they
want  through  our  website,  bjs.com,  and  our  highly  rated  mobile  app,  which  allows  them  to  use  our  buy-online-
pickup-in-club ("BOPIC") service, curbside delivery, same-day home delivery or traditional ship-to-home service, as
well  as  through  the  DoorDash  and  Instacart  marketplaces  where  members  receive  preferential  pricing  by  linking
their membership. We also oﬀer Same-Day Select, which oﬀers BJ’s members the ability to pay a one-time fee for
either unlimited or twelve same-day grocery deliveries over a one-year period.

Our leadership team continues to focus on utilizing data to improve member experience, instilling a culture of
cost discipline, adopting a more proactive approach to growing our membership base and building an omnichannel
oﬀering oriented towards making shopping at BJ’s more convenient.

Our  goal  is  to  oﬀer  our  members  signiﬁcant  value  and  a  meaningful  return  in  savings  on  their  annual
membership  fee.  We  have  approximately  7.0  million  members  paying  annual  fees  to  gain  access  to  savings  on
groceries  and  general  merchandise  and  services.  The  annual  membership  fee  for  our  Club  Card  membership  is
generally  $55,  and  the  annual  membership  fee  for  our  BJ’s  Club+  membership,  which  oﬀers  additional  value-
enhancing  features,  is  generally  $110.  We  believe  that  members  can  save  over  ten  times  their  $55  Club  Card
membership  fee  versus  what  they  would  otherwise  pay  at  traditional  supermarket  competitors  when  they  spend
$2,500 or more per year at BJ’s on manufacturer-branded groceries. In addition to providing signiﬁcant savings on a
representative  basket  of  manufacturer-branded  groceries,  we  accept  all  manufacturer  coupons  and  also  carry  our
own exclusive brands that enable members to save on price without compromising on quality. Our two private label
brands,  Wellsley  Farms®  and  Berkley  Jensen®,  represented  over  $3.7  billion  in  annual  sales  for  ﬁscal  year  2022
and  are  the  largest  brands  we  sell  in  terms  of  volume.  Our  customers  recognize  the  relevance  of  our  value
proposition  across  economic  environments,  as  demonstrated  by  over  25  consecutive  years  of  membership  fee
income growth. Our membership fee income was $407.5 million for the trailing twelve-months ended July 29, 2023.

Our business is moderately seasonal in nature. Historically, our business has realized a slightly higher portion
of net sales, operating income, and cash ﬂows from operations in the second and fourth ﬁscal quarters, attributable
primarily to the impact of the summer and year-end holiday season, respectively. Our quarterly results have been,
and will continue to be, aﬀected by the timing of new club openings and their associated pre-opening expenses. As
a  result  of  these  factors,  our  ﬁnancial  results  for  any  single  quarter  or  for  periods  of  less  than  a  year  are  not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full ﬁscal year.

19

Factors Aﬀecting Our Business

Overall economic trends

The overall economic environment and related changes in consumer behavior have a signiﬁcant impact on our
business.  In  general,  positive  conditions  in  the  broader  economy  promote  customer  spending  in  our  clubs,  while
economic  weakness,  which  generally  results  in  a  reduction  of  customer  spending,  may  have  a  diﬀerent  or  more
extreme eﬀect on spending at our clubs. Macroeconomic factors that can aﬀect customer spending patterns, and
thereby  our  results  of  operations,  include  employment  rates,  changes  to  the  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance
Program  (SNAP),  government  stimulus  programs,  tax  legislation,  business  conditions,  changes  in  the  housing
market,  the  availability  of  credit,  interest  rates,  tax  rates  and  fuel  and  energy  costs.  In  addition,  unemployment
rates and beneﬁts may cause us to experience higher labor costs.

Size and loyalty of membership base

The membership model is a critical element of our business. Members drive our results of operations through
their  membership  fee  income  and  their  purchases.  The  majority  of  members  renew  within  six  months  following
their  renewal  date.  Therefore,  our  renewal  rate  is  a  trailing  calculation  that  captures  renewals  during  the  period
seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We have grown our membership fee income each year for the
past 25 years and the quality of our membership mix is strong as evidenced by our higher tier penetration growth
in  the  ﬁrst  twenty-six  weeks  of  ﬁscal  year  2023.  Our  membership  renewal  rate,  a  key  indicator  of  membership
engagement, satisfaction and loyalty, was 90% at the end of ﬁscal year 2022.

Eﬀective sourcing and distribution of products and consumer demands

Our  net  sales  and  gross  proﬁt  are  aﬀected  by  our  ability  to  purchase  our  products  in  suﬃcient  quantities  at
competitive  prices.  Further,  our  ability  to  maintain  our  appeal  to  existing  customers  and  attract  new  customers
primarily  depends  on  our  ability  to  originate,  develop  and  oﬀer  a  compelling  product  assortment  responsive  to
customer  preferences.  As  a  result,  our  level  of  net  sales  could  be  adversely  aﬀected  due  to  constraints  in  our
supply  chain,  including  our  inability  to  procure  and  stock  suﬃcient  quantities  of  some  merchandise  in  a  manner
that is able to match market demand from our customers.

Infrastructure investment

Our historical operating results reﬂect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have
made  signiﬁcant  investments  in  our  business  that  we  believe  have  laid  the  foundation  for  continued  proﬁtable
growth. We believe that expanding our club footprint, bringing substantially all of our end-to-end perishable supply
chain  in-house,  enhancing  our  information  systems,  including  our  distribution  center  and  transportation
management systems, and investing in hardware and digitally enabled shopping capabilities for convenience, such
as BOPIC, curbside pickup, and same day home delivery will enable us to replicate our proﬁtable club format and
provide a diﬀerentiated shopping experience. We expect these infrastructure investments to support our successful
operating model across our club operations.

Gasoline prices

The  market  price  of  gasoline  impacts  our  net  sales  and  comparable  club  sales,  and  large  ﬂuctuations  in  the
price of gasoline may produce a short-term impact on our margins. Retail gasoline prices are driven by daily crude
oil  and  wholesale  commodity  market  changes  and  are  volatile,  as  they  are  inﬂuenced  by  factors  that  include
changes in demand and supply of oil and reﬁned products, global geopolitical events, regional market conditions,
and supply interruptions caused by severe weather conditions. Typically, the change in crude oil prices impacts the
purchase  price  of  wholesale  petroleum  fuel  products,  which  in  turn  impacts  retail  gasoline  prices  at  the  pump.
During  times  when  prices  are  particularly  volatile,  diﬀerences  in  pricing  and  procurement  strategies  between  the
Company  and  its  competitors  may  lead  to  temporary  margin  contraction  or  expansion,  depending  on  whether
prices are rising or falling, and this impact could aﬀect our overall results for a ﬁscal quarter.

In addition, the relative level of gasoline prices from period to period may lead to diﬀerences in our net sales
between  those  periods.  Further,  because  we  generally  attempt  to  maintain  a  fairly  stable  gross  proﬁt  per  gallon,
this  variance  in  net  sales,  which  may  be  substantial,  may  or  may  not  have  a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  our  operating
income.

Inﬂation and deﬂation trends

20

Our ﬁnancial results can be directly impacted by substantial changes in product costs due to commodity cost
increases or general inﬂation, which could lead to a reduction in our sales, as well as greater margin pressure, as
costs  may  not  be  able  to  be  passed  on  to  consumers.  Changes  in  commodity  prices  and  general  inﬂation  have
impacted  several  categories  of  our  business.  Inﬂationary  pressures  can  be  attributed  to  macro  economic  factors
including supply chain disruptions, government stimulus, interest rates, and other factors. In response to increasing
commodity prices or general inﬂation, we seek to minimize the impact of such events by sourcing our merchandise
from diﬀerent vendors, changing our product mix or increasing our pricing when necessary.

Ended July 30, 2022 (Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022) 

Net Sales 

Net  sales  are  derived  from  direct  retail  sales  to  customers,  net  of  merchandise  returns  and  discounts.

Fluctuations in net sales are impacted by opening new clubs and comparable club sales.

Net sales for the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 were $4.9 billion, a 2.9% decrease from net sales reported
for the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022 of $5.0 billion. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in gasoline
sales during the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023.

Comparable Club Sales and Merchandise Comparable Club Sales

We believe net sales is an important driver of our proﬁtability, particularly comparable club sales. Changes in
comparable sales are driven by variations in shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount
they spend on each visit. Sales comparisons can be inﬂuenced by certain factors that are beyond our control such
as changes in the cost of gasoline and macro-economic factors such as inﬂation. The higher comparable club sales,
the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a
percentage of sales and enhancing proﬁtability.

(5.3)%

(6.4)%
1.1 %

Merchandise comparable club sales increased by 1.1% in the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to
the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022 primarily driven by an increase in sales of groceries of 4.1%, partially oﬀset
by a decrease in sales of general merchandise and services of approximately 13.3%.

In  grocery,  sales  increased  for  snacks,  beverages,  breakfast  items,  dairy,  frozen,  and  bakery  categories
compared to the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022, partially oﬀset by a decrease in sales of fresh meat, vitamins,
and household categories.

Sales of general merchandise decreased in the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 due to decreased demand
for electronics, home, and seasonal merchandise compared to the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022, driven by the
unfavorable impact of weather and macroeconomic factors.

The impact of gasoline sales is a result of lower retail prices in the second quarter of ﬁscal 2023 as compared

to the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022, as well as a slight decline in comparable gallons.

Membership fee income 

We continue to see growth in the size of our membership base and continued quality. Membership fee income
was  $103.7  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  compared  to  $98.8  million  in  the  second  quarter  of
ﬁscal year 2022, a 5.0% increase. The increase was primarily driven by membership renewals, new members, and
greater penetration of higher-tier membership levels, evidencing the strength of our membership quality.

In  connection  with  our  co-brand  credit  card  transition  in  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  we  oﬀered  a  5
cent-per-gallon  discount  on  gasoline  purchases  to  our  Club+  members.  We  believe  the  new  program  has  helped
drive continued growth in our higher-tier membership penetration.

Cost of sales 

Cost  of  sales  consists  primarily  of  the  direct  cost  of  merchandise  and  gasoline  sold  at  our  clubs,  including
costs  associated  with  operating  our  distribution  centers,  including  payroll,  payroll  beneﬁts,  occupancy  costs,  and
depreciation; freight

 
22

expenses  associated  with  moving  merchandise  from  vendors  to  our  distribution  centers  and  from  distribution
centers to our clubs; and vendor allowances, rebates, and cash discounts.

Cost  of  sales  was  $4.1  billion,  or  83.7%  of  net  sales,  in  the  second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  compared  to
$4.2 billion, or 84.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022. Merchandise gross margin rate, which
excludes  gasoline  sales  and  membership  fee  income,  increased  90  basis  points  over  the  prior  year  period.  The
improvement  in  merchandise  margins  was  primarily  due  to  disinﬂation,  moderated  supply  chain  costs,  and
improvement of inventory management.

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

SG&A consists of various expenses related to supporting and facilitating the sale of merchandise in our clubs,
including  the  following:  payroll  and  payroll  beneﬁts  for  team  members;  rent,  depreciation,  and  other  occupancy
costs  for  retail  and  corporate  locations;  share-based  compensation,  advertising  expenses;  tender  costs,  including
credit  and  debit  card  fees;  amortization  of  intangible  assets;  and  consulting,  legal,  insurance,  acquisition  and
integration costs, and other professional services expenses.

SG&A includes both ﬁxed and variable components and, therefore, is not directly correlated with net sales. We
expect that our SG&A will increase in future periods due to investments to spur comparable club sales growth and
our  expanding  footprint  as  we  open  new  clubs.  In  addition,  any  future  increases  in  wages,  stock-based  grants  or
modiﬁcations will increase our SG&A.

SG&A increased by 6.7% to $695.0 million in the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 from $651.2 million in the
second  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  The  year-over-year  increase  in  SG&A  was  primarily  driven  by  increased  labor
and occupancy costs as a result of new club and gas station openings, as well as other continued investments to
drive  strategic  priorities.  Our  growth  proﬁle  this  year  is  weighted  toward  owned  clubs,  elevating  our  depreciation
expense. We remain focused on investing in member engagement, marketing and digital strategies.

Pre-opening expenses

Pre-opening  expenses  include  startup  costs  for  new  clubs.  Expenses  will  vary  based  on  the  number  of  new
club openings, geography of the club, whether the club is owned or leased, and timing of the opening relative to
our period end.

Pre-opening expenses were $1.6 million in the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $5.9 million in
the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022. Pre-opening expenses decreased due to timing of spend for club openings
year-over-year. 

Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net was $16.3 million in the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $10.9 million in

the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to rising interest rates year-over-year.

Provision for income taxes 

The  Company’s  eﬀective  income  tax  rate  from  continuing  operations  was  28.6%  and  26.6%  for  the  second
quarters  of  ﬁscal  years  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  The  increase  in  the  eﬀective  tax  rate  is  primarily  due  to  a
reduction in excess tax beneﬁts from stock-based compensation and lower tax credits in the current period.

Twenty-six Weeks Ended July 29, 2023 (First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2023) Compared to Twenty-six
Weeks Ended July 30, 2022 (First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2022) 

Net Sales 

Net sales for the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2023 were $9.5 billion, a 0.8% increase from net sales reported
for the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022 of $9.4 billion. The increase was due primarily to a net increase of nine
club openings, partially oﬀset by lower gasoline sales.

Merchandise comparable club sales increased by 3.3% in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to
the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022 driven by an increase in sales of groceries of approximately 6.0%, partially
oﬀset by a decrease in sales of general merchandise and services of approximately 11.0%.

In  grocery,  sales  increased  in  the  current  year  period  as  demand  for  beverages,  candy,  snacks,  dairy,  and
bakery categories increased compared to the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022, partially oﬀset by a decrease in
demand for fresh meat and household categories.

General  merchandise  decreased  in  the  current  year  period  due  to  decreased  demand  for  electronics  and

seasonal merchandise compared to the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022.

The  impact  of  gasoline  sales  is  a  result  of  lower  retail  prices  through  the  ﬁrst  six  months  of  ﬁscal  2023  as

compared to the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022. Gallons remained relatively ﬂat period over period.

Membership fee income 

Membership  fee  income  was  $206.2  million  in  the  ﬁrst  six  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  compared  to  $195.4
million  in  the  ﬁrst  six  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2022,  a  5.5%  increase.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven  by
membership renewals, new members, and increased penetration of higher-tier membership levels, evidencing the
strength of our membership quality. 

Cost of sales 

Cost of sales was $7.9 billion, or 83.4% of net sales, in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2023, remaining ﬂat
compared  to  $7.9  billion,  or  84.5%  of  net  sales,  in  the  ﬁrst  six  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  Merchandise  gross
margin rate, which excludes gasoline sales and membership fee income, increased 100 basis points in the current
year period over the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022. The improvement in merchandise margins was primarily
due to disinﬂation, moderated supply chain costs, and improved inventory management.

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

SG&A increased by 7.5% to $1.4 billion in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2023 from $1.3 billion in the ﬁrst
six  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  The  year-over-year  increase  in  SG&A  was  primarily  driven  by  increased  labor  and
occupancy costs as a result of new club and gas station openings, as well as other continued investments to drive
strategic  priorities.  Our  growth  proﬁle  this  year  is  weighted  toward  owned  clubs,  elevating  our  depreciation
expense. We remain focused on investing in member engagement, marketing and digital strategies.

Pre-opening expenses

Pre-opening expenses were $5.5 million in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $10.8 million in
the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022. Pre-opening expenses decreased due to timing of spend for club openings
year-over-year. 

Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net was $31.0 million in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $18.7 million in

the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to rising interest rates year-over-year.

Provision for income taxes 

The  Company’s  eﬀective  income  tax  rate  from  continuing  operations  was  30.5%  and  24.2%  for  the  ﬁrst  six
months of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an immaterial adjustment to
certain deferred tax

 
24

assets related to prior periods, as well as lower excess tax beneﬁts from stock-based compensation and lower tax
credits in the current period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented
in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  addition  to  relevant  GAAP  measures  we  also  provide  non-GAAP  measures,  including
adjusted EBITDA, comparable club sales, free cash ﬂow, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted
share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts by excluding items that we
do  not  believe  are  indicative  of  our  core  operating  performance.  These  measures  are  customary  for  our  industry
and  commonly  used  by  competitors.  These  non-GAAP  ﬁnancial  measures  should  not  be  reviewed  in  isolation  or
considered as an alternative to any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and should not
be  construed  as  an  inference  that  our  future  results  will  be  unaﬀected  by  unusual  or  non-recurring  items.  In
addition, adjusted EBITDA, comparable club sales, free cash ﬂow, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per
diluted share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across
diﬀerent industries. Free cash ﬂow is discussed within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted  EBITDA  is  deﬁned  as  income  from  continuing  operations  before  interest  expense,  net,  provision  for
income  taxes  and  depreciation  and  amortization,  adjusted  for  the  impact  of  certain  other  items,  including  stock-
based  compensation  expense;  pre-opening  expenses;  non-cash  rent;  acquisition  and  integration  costs;  and  other
adjustments.

Comparable Club Sales and Merchandise Comparable Club Sales

Comparable  club  sales,  also  known  as  same-store  sales,  includes  all  clubs  that  were  open  for  at  least  13
months at the beginning of the period and were in operation during the entirety of both periods being compared,
including relocated clubs and expansions.

Comparable  club  sales  allow  us  to  evaluate  how  our  club  base  is  performing  by  measuring  the  change  in
period-over-period  net  sales  in  clubs  that  have  been  open  for  the  applicable  period.  Various  factors  aﬀect
comparable club sales, including

25

consumer  preferences  and  trends,  product  sourcing,  promotional  oﬀerings  and  pricing,  customer  experience  and
purchase amounts, weather and holiday shopping period timing and length.

Merchandise  comparable  club  sales  represents  comparable  club  sales  from  all  merchandise  other  than  our

gasoline operations for the applicable period.

Adjusted Net Income

The adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share metrics are important measures used by
management  to  compare  the  performance  of  core  operating  results  between  periods.  We  deﬁne  adjusted  net
income as net income as reported, adjusted for non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual charges, net of the tax impact
of  such  adjustments.  We  deﬁne  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share  as  adjusted  net  income  divided  by  the
weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.

We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and
analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per
diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash ﬂows generated from club operations and borrowings from our ABL
Revolving Facility. As of July 29, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $26.2 million and we had $726.2 million of
unused  capacity  under  our  ABL  Revolving  Facility.  Our  principal  liquidity  needs  for  the  next  twelve  months  and
beyond  are  to  fund  normal  recurring  operational  expenses  and  anticipated  capital  expenditures;  fund  possible
acquisitions; fund share repurchases; and meet debt service and principal repayment obligations. We believe that
our current resources, together with anticipated cash ﬂows from operations and borrowing capacity under our ABL
Revolving Facility, will be suﬃcient to ﬁnance our operations for at least the next twelve months.

In  the  ﬁrst  six  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  we  used  $59.9  million  of  available  cash  to  repurchase  919,162

shares under the 2021 Repurchase Program.

We  do  not  have  any  oﬀ-balance  sheet  arrangements  that  have,  or  are,  in  the  opinion  of  management,
reasonably likely to have, a current or future material eﬀect on our results of operations or ﬁnancial position. We do,
however, enter into letters of credit and purchase obligations in the normal course of our operations.

Summary of Cash Flows

A  summary  of  our  cash  ﬂows  from  operating,  investing  and  ﬁnancing  activities  is  presented  in  the  following

Net cash provided by operating activities was $269.5 million for the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to
$443.1  million  for  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  The  decrease  in  operating  cash  ﬂow  was  primarily  due  to
unfavorable  ﬂuctuations  in  working  capital  and  a  decrease  in  pre-tax  net  income.  The  unfavorable  ﬂuctuations  in
working capital were primarily due to merchandise inventories and accounts payable.

Net Investing Cash Flows 

Cash used in investing activities was $208.3 million for the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal year 2023, compared to $565.4
million for the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal year 2022. The decrease is primarily due to $376.5 million of cash outﬂows in the
prior year related to the Acquisition.

Net Financing Cash Flows 

Net  cash  used  in  ﬁnancing  activities  for  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  was  $69.0  million  compared  to  net
cash provided by ﬁnancing activities of $240.6 million for the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal year 2022. The $309.5 million net
increase  in  ﬁnancing  cash  outﬂows  was  primarily  due  to  a  $344.0  million  reduction  in  net  proceeds  from  our  ABL
Revolving  Facility  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  compared  to  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  year  2022,  as  well  as  an
incremental $12.7 million outﬂow for the acquisition of treasury stock, partially oﬀset by a $50.0 million payment
on long-term debt in the prior year.

Free Cash Flow

We  present  free  cash  ﬂow  because  we  use  it  to  report  to  our  board  of  directors  and  we  believe  it  assists
investors and analysts in evaluating our liquidity. Free cash ﬂow should not be considered as an alternative to cash
ﬂows from operations as a liquidity measure. We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities
less additions to property and equipment, net of disposals, plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions.

The following is a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash ﬂow for the

periods presented:

year  2023  compared  to  $254.2  million  for  the  ﬁrst  half  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  For  each  comparative  period,  the
decrease  is  the  primary  result  of  lower  cash  ﬂows  from  operating  activities  as  a  result  of  ﬂuctuations  in  working
capital.

Debt and Borrowing Capacity  

Our primary sources of borrowing capacity are the ABL Revolving Facility and the First Lien Term Loan, which

are further discussed in Note 4, "Debt and Credit Arrangements," included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

On  July  28,  2022,  the  Company  entered  into  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  with  an  aggregate  ABL  Revolving
Commitment of $1.2 billion pursuant to that certain credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative
agent  and  collateral  agent,  and  other  lenders  party  thereto.  The  maturity  date  of  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  is
July 28, 2027. As part of this transaction, the Company extinguished the ABL Facility.

On  January  5,  2023,  the  Company  amended  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan  to  extend  the  maturity  date  from
February 3, 2024 to February 3, 2027 and transition the interest rate from London Interbank Oﬀered Rate (“LIBOR”)
to  the  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  (“SOFR”)  and  changes  the  applicable  margin  from  LIBOR  plus  200  –  225
basis points per annum to SOFR plus 275 basis points per annum. In connection with the amendment the Company
made a paid approximately $151.9 million of the principal amount.

At  July  29,  2023,  there  was  $411.0  million  outstanding  in  loans  under  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  and  $11.3
million  in  outstanding  letters  of  credit.  The  interest  rate  on  the  revolving  credit  facility  was  6.42%  and  unused
capacity was $726.2 million.

At  July  29,  2023,  the  interest  rate  for  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan  was  7.89%  and  there  was  $450.0

million outstanding.

Material Cash Commitments 

Our material cash commitments consist primarily of debt obligations, interest payments, leases, and purchase
orders for merchandise inventory. These material cash commitments impact our short-term and long-term liquidity
and capital needs. As of July 29, 2023, other than those items related to the ordinary course of operations of our
business such as inventory purchases, new leases and lease amendments, there were no material changes to our
material cash commitments from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

This  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  ﬁnancial  condition  and  results  of  operations  is  based  on  our  condensed
consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements,  which  we  have  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  The  preparation  of  our
ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that aﬀect
the  reported  amount  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  costs  and  expenses,  and  related  disclosures.  There  were  no
material changes in critical accounting policies and estimates during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form  10-Q.  Refer  to  Item  7.,  "Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of
Operations— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022
for a complete list of our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

There  have  been  no  recent  accounting  pronouncements  since  those  disclosed  in  our  Annual  Report  on  Form

10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022 that have had a material impact on our ﬁnancial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We  are  exposed  to  changes  in  market  interest  rates  and  these  changes  in  rates  will  impact  our  net  interest
expense and our cash ﬂow from operations. Substantially all of our borrowings carry variable interest rates. There
have been no material changes in our market risk from the disclosure included in Part II. "Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risk" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Limitations on Eﬀectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and  procedures,  no  matter  how  well  designed  and  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving
the desired control

28

objectives.  In  addition,  the  design  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  must  reﬂect  the  fact  that  there  are
resource  constraints  and  that  management  is  required  to  apply  judgment  in  evaluating  the  beneﬁts  of  possible
controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, evaluated,
as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q,  the  eﬀectiveness  of  our  disclosure
controls  and  procedures,  as  deﬁned  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act.  Based  on  that
evaluation,  our  Chief  Executive  Oﬃcer  and  Chief  Financial  Oﬃcer  concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures were eﬀective at the reasonable assurance level as of July 29, 2023. 

Changes in Internal Control

There were no changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting identiﬁed in management’s evaluation
pursuant  to  Rules  13a-15  or  15d-15  of  the  Exchange  Act  during  the  most  recently  completed  ﬁscal  quarter  that
materially aﬀected, or are reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION

We are subject to various litigation, claims and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of business. We believe these actions are routine and incidental to the business. While the outcome of these
actions cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any will have a material adverse impact on our
business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

There have been no material changes to the risk factors relating to the Company set forth under the caption

"Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
