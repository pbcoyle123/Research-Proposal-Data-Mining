Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

1. Accounting Policies

These  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  rules  and
regulations  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  applicable  to  interim  ﬁnancial  statements.  While  these
statements  reﬂect  all  normal  recurring  adjustments  that  are,  in  the  opinion  of  management,  necessary  for  fair
presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (U.S.  GAAP)  for  complete  ﬁnancial  statements.  These
condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements should be read in conjunction with the ﬁnancial statement disclosures
in our most recent Form 10-K.

We use the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual ﬁnancial statements.

We  operate  as  a  single  segment  that  is  designed  to  enable  guests  to  purchase  products  seamlessly  in  stores  or
through our digital channels. Nearly all of our revenues are generated in the U.S. The vast majority of our long-lived
assets are located within the U.S.

Due  to  the  seasonal  nature  of  our  business,  quarterly  revenues,  expenses,  earnings,  and  cash  ﬂows  are  not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.

Merchandise sales — We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may
include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Sales are
recognized  net  of  expected  returns,  which  we  estimate  using  historical  return  patterns  and  our  expectation  of
future returns. As of July 29, 2023, January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022, the accrual for estimated returns was $177
million, $174 million, and $175 million, respectively.

Revenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of
issuance.

receivables in exchange for performing account servicing and primary marketing functions. TD underwrites, funds,
and owns Target Credit Card and Target MasterCard receivables, controls risk management policies, and oversees
regulatory compliance.

The  carrying  amounts  of  certain  other  current  assets,  commercial  paper,  accounts  payable,  and  certain
accrued and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
The fair value of debt is generally measured using a discounted cash ﬂow analysis based on current market
interest rates for the same or similar types of ﬁnancial instruments and would be classiﬁed as Level 2. These
amounts exclude commercial paper, fair value hedge adjustments, and lease liabilities.

4. Supplier Finance Programs

We  have  arrangements  with  several  ﬁnancial  institutions  to  act  as  our  paying  agents  to  certain  vendors.  The
arrangements  also  permit  the  ﬁnancial  institutions  to  provide  vendors  with  an  option,  at  our  vendors'  sole
discretion,  to  sell  their  receivables  from  Target  to  the  ﬁnancial  institutions.  A  vendor’s  election  to  receive  early
payment at a discounted amount from the ﬁnancial institutions does not change the amount that we must remit to
the ﬁnancial institutions or our payment date, which is up to 120 days from the invoice date.

We  do  not  pay  any  fees  or  pledge  any  security  to  these  ﬁnancial  institutions  under  these  arrangements.  The
arrangements can be terminated by either party with notice ranging up to 120 days.

Our  outstanding  vendor  obligations  eligible  for  early  payment  under  these  arrangements  totaled  $3.7  billion,
$3.4 billion, and $4.6 billion as of July 29, 2023, January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022, respectively, and are included
within Accounts Payable on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Our outstanding vendor obligations
do not represent actual receivables sold by our vendors to the ﬁnancial institutions, which may be lower.

5. Property and Equipment

We  review  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  when  store  performance  expectations,  events,  or  changes  in
circumstances—such as a decision to relocate or close a store, oﬃce, or distribution center, discontinue a project,
or  make  signiﬁcant  software  changes—indicate  that  the  asset’s  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable.  We
recognized  impairment  charges  of  $33  million  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  July  29,  2023.  We  recognized
impairment charges of $27 million and $50 million for the three and six months ended July 30, 2022, respectively.
These impairment charges are included in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A).

6. Commercial Paper and Long-Term Debt

We obtain short-term ﬁnancing from time to time under our commercial paper program. For the six months ended
July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, the maximum amounts outstanding were $90 million and $1.5 billion, respectively,
and the average daily amounts outstanding were $2 million and $538 million, respectively, at a weighted average
annual interest rate of 4.9 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. No balances were outstanding as of July 29, 2023.
As  of  July  30,  2022,  $1.5  billion  was  outstanding  and  is  classiﬁed  within  Current  Portion  of  Long-Term  Debt  and
Other Borrowings on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

7. Derivative Financial Instruments

Our  derivative  instruments  consist  of  interest  rate  swaps  used  to  mitigate  interest  rate  risk.  As  a  result,  we  have
counterparty credit exposure to large global ﬁnancial institutions, which we monitor on an ongoing basis. Note 3 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements provides the fair value and classiﬁcation of these instruments.

We  were  party  to  interest  rate  swaps  with  notional  amounts  totaling  $2.45  billion  as  of  July  29,  2023  and
January 28, 2023, and $2.25 billion as of July 30, 2022. We pay a ﬂoating rate and receive a ﬁxed rate under each
of  these  agreements.  All  of  the  agreements  are  designated  as  fair  value  hedges,  and  all  were  considered  to  be
perfectly  eﬀective  under  the  shortcut  method  during  the  three  and  six  months  ended  July  29,  2023  and  July  30,
2022.

During  2023,  we  amended  interest  rate  swaps  with  notional  amounts  totaling  $1.5  billion  to  replace  the  London
Interbank  Oﬀered  Rate  (LIBOR)  with  the  daily  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  (SOFR)  as  part  of  our  planned
reference  rate  reform  activities.  These  amendments  did  not  result  in  any  change  to  our  application  of  hedge
accounting or any impact to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

We  were  party  to  forward-starting  interest  rate  swaps  with  notional  amounts  totaling  $2.15  billion  as  of  July  30,
2022.  During  2022,  we  terminated  all  remaining  forward-starting  interest  rate  swap  agreements.  The  resulting
gains  upon  termination  were  recorded  in  Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Loss  and  will  be  recognized  as  a
reduction to Net Interest Expense over the respective term of the debt.

FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Financial Summary

Second quarter 2023 included the following notable items:

• GAAP and Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.80.
•

Total  revenue  was  $24.8  billion,  a  decrease  of  (4.9)  percent,  reﬂecting  a  total  sales  decrease  of  (4.9)  percent
and a 1.3 percent increase in other revenue.
Comparable  sales  decreased  (5.4)  percent,  reﬂecting  a  (4.8)  percent  decrease  in  traﬃc  and  a  (0.7)  percent
decrease in average transaction amount.

•

◦ Comparable stores-originated sales declined (4.3) percent.
◦ Comparable digitally-originated sales declined (10.5) percent.

• Operating income of $1.2 billion was 273.0 percent higher than the comparable prior-year period. See Business

Environment below for additional information.

Cash ﬂow provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with
$47  million  cash  ﬂow  required  for  operating  activities  for  the  six  months  ended  July  30,  2022.  The  drivers  of  the
operating cash ﬂow increase are described on page 21.

Note:  Amounts  may  not  foot  due  to  rounding.  Adjusted  diluted  earnings  per  share  (Adjusted  EPS),  a  non-GAAP
metric, excludes the impact of certain items. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-
to-period  comparisons  of  the  results  of  our  operations.  A  reconciliation  of  non-GAAP  ﬁnancial  measures  to  GAAP
measures is provided on page 19.

We  report  after-tax  return  on  invested  capital  (ROIC)  because  we  believe  ROIC  provides  a  meaningful  measure  of
our  capital  allocation  eﬀectiveness  over  time.  For  the  trailing  twelve  months  ended  July  29,  2023,  after-tax  ROIC
was 13.7 percent, compared with 18.4 percent for the trailing twelve months ended July 30, 2022. The calculation
of ROIC is provided on page 20.

Business Environment

During the ﬁrst two quarters of 2023, sales growth in our Frequency categories (Beauty & Household Essentials and
Food  &  Beverage)  was  more  than  oﬀset  by  accelerating  decreases  in  our  Discretionary  categories  (Apparel  &
Accessories, Hardlines, and Home Furnishings & Décor). This trend of decreased Discretionary category sales began
in 2022. In response to this trend, during 2022 we took actions and employed strategies to align inventories with
sales trends. These actions, as well as improvements in the supply chain, have resulted in decreased inventory as
of  July  29,  2023  compared  with  January  28,  2023  and  July  30,  2022.  These  actions  and  improvements  have  also
resulted  in  a  reduction  in  costs  related  to  managing  elevated  inventory  levels  and  reduced  our  working  capital
investment.

Along with supply chain improvements, we have experienced a signiﬁcant decrease in freight costs due to a decline
in  freight  rates  compared  to  2022.  We  have  also  experienced  lower  digital  fulﬁllment  costs  due  to  a  decrease  in
digital sales and a continued shift by our guests to lower-cost same-day fulﬁllment options.

We continue to experience higher inventory shrink, as a percentage of sales, relative to historical levels — including
signiﬁcantly higher shrink rates at certain stores. We believe that this trend is pervasive across the retail industry.
Increased  shrink  has  had,  and  if  current  trends  persist  will  continue  to  have,  an  adverse  impact  on  our  results  of
operations, including potential impairment of our long-lived assets.

The Gross Margin Rate analysis on page 17 and the Inventory section on page 21 provide additional information.

Sales

Sales  include  all  merchandise  sales,  net  of  expected  returns,  and  our  estimate  of  gift  card  breakage.  We  use
comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in
sales  for  a  period  over  the  comparable  prior-year  period  of  equivalent  length.  Comparable  sales  include  all  sales,
except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores
that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across
the  retail  industry.  As  a  result,  our  comparable  sales  calculation  is  not  necessarily  comparable  to  similarly  titled
measures  reported  by  other  companies.  Digitally  originated  sales  include  all  sales  initiated  through  mobile
applications  and  our  websites.  Our  stores  fulﬁll  the  majority  of  digitally  originated  sales,  including  shipment  from
stores  to  guests,  store  Order  Pickup  or  Drive  Up,  and  delivery  via  Shipt.  Digitally  originated  sales  may  also  be
fulﬁlled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.

Sales  growth—from  both  comparable  sales  and  new  stores—represents  an  important  driver  of  our  long-term
proﬁtability.  We  expect  that  comparable  sales  growth  will  drive  the  majority  of  our  total  sales  growth.  We  believe
that  our  ability  to  successfully  diﬀerentiate  our  guests’  shopping  experience  through  a  careful  combination  of
merchandise  assortment,  price,  convenience,  guest  experience,  and  other  factors  will,  over  the  long-term,  drive
both increasing shopping frequency (number of transactions, or "traﬃc") and the amount spent each visit (average
transaction amount).

Note  2  to  the  Financial  Statements  provides  additional  product  category  sales  information.  The  collective
interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix
and the transfer of sales to new stores, makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.

We  monitor  the  percentage  of  purchases  that  are  paid  for  using  RedCards  (RedCard  Penetration)  because  our
internal  analysis  has  indicated  that  a  meaningful  portion  of  the  incremental  purchases  on  RedCards  are  also
incremental  sales  for  Target.  Guests  receive  a  5  percent  discount  on  virtually  all  purchases  when  they  use  a
RedCard at Target. For the three months ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, total RedCard Penetration was 18.6
percent  and  20.1  percent,  respectively.  For  the  six  months  ended  July  29,  2023  and  July  30,  2022,  total  RedCard
Penetration was 18.8 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively.

For the three months ended July 29, 2023, our gross margin rate was 27.0 percent compared with 21.5 percent in
the comparable prior-year period. For the six months ended July 29, 2023, our gross margin rate was 26.7 percent
compared with 23.5 percent in the comparable prior-year period. For both the three and six months ended July 29,
2023, the increase reﬂected the net impact of

• merchandising beneﬁt, including

◦

◦
◦

lower  clearance  and  promotional  markdown  rates  and  other  costs  compared  with  the  prior-year,
which included the impact of inventory impairments and other actions;
lower freight costs; and

•

lower  digital  fulﬁllment  costs  due  to  a  decrease  in  digital  volume  and  a  shift  by  our  guests  to  lower-cost

Net Interest Expense

Net  interest  expense  was  $141  million  and  $288  million  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  July  29,  2023,
respectively,  compared  with  $112  million  and  $224  million  in  the  respective  comparable  prior-year  periods.  The
increase  in  net  interest  expense  was  primarily  due  to  higher  average  debt  levels  in  addition  to  higher  ﬂoating
interest rates for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023 compared with the prior-year periods.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our eﬀective income tax rate for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023 was 22.2 percent and 21.6 percent,
respectively,  compared  with  15.8  percent  and  18.7  percent  in  the  respective  comparable  prior-year  periods.The
increase reﬂects higher pretax earnings in the current year, resulting in a smaller tax rate beneﬁt from ongoing and
discrete tax items.

Earnings  before  interest  expense  and  income  taxes  (EBIT)  and  earnings  before  interest  expense,  income  taxes,
depreciation,  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  are  non-GAAP  ﬁnancial  measures.  We  believe  these  measures  provide
meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of
diﬀerences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and, for EBITDA, capital investment. These measures are
not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings. EBIT and
EBITDA  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a  substitution  for  analysis  of  our  results  as  reported  in

Analysis of Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Capital Allocation

We  follow  a  disciplined  and  balanced  approach  to  capital  allocation  based  on  the  following  priorities,  ranked  in
order of importance: ﬁrst, we fully invest in opportunities to proﬁtably grow our business, create sustainable long-
term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend
and seek to grow it annually; and ﬁnally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within
the limits of our credit rating goals.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.6 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion as of July 29, 2023, January 28,
2023,  and  July  30,  2022,  respectively.  Our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  balance  included  short-term  investments  of
$739 million, $1.3 billion, and $189 million as of July 29, 2023, January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022, respectively.
Our  investment  policy  is  designed  to  preserve  principal  and  liquidity  of  our  short-term  investments.  This  policy
allows investments in large money market funds or in highly-rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60
days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.

Operating Cash Flows

Cash ﬂows provided by operating activities were $3.4 billion for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with
$47 million of cash ﬂows required for operating activities for the six months ended July 30, 2022. For the six months
ended  July  29,  2023,  operating  cash  ﬂows  increased  as  a  result  of  higher  net  earnings  and  an  improvement  in
working capital, including lower inventory levels, compared with the six months ended July 30, 2022.

Inventory

Inventory was $12.7 billion as of July 29, 2023, compared with $13.5 billion and $15.3 billion at January 28, 2023
and July 30, 2022, respectively. The decrease from the balance as of July 30, 2022 primarily reﬂects actions taken to
align  inventory  levels  with  sales  trends  and  improvements  in  the  supply  chain,  including  reduced  in-transit
inventory.

The Business Environment section on page 14 provides additional information.

Investing Cash Flows

Cash required for investing activities increased to $2.8 billion for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared to
$2.5 billion for the six months ended July 30, 2022, due to capital investments.

Dividends

We paid dividends totaling $499 million ($1.08 per share) and $996 million ($2.16 per share) for the three and six
months ended July 29, 2023, respectively, and $417 million ($0.90 per share) and $841 million ($1.80 per share) for
the  three  and  six  months  ended  July  30,  2022,  respectively,  a  per  share  increase  of  20.0  percent.  We  declared
dividends  totaling  $516  million  ($1.10  per  share)  during  the  second  quarter  of  2023  and  $502  million  ($1.08  per
share)  during  the  second  quarter  of  2022,  a  per  share  increase  of  1.9  percent.  We  have  paid  dividends  every
quarter since our 1967 initial public oﬀering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.

Share Repurchase

We did not repurchase any shares during the six months ended July 29, 2023. See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales
of  Equity  Securities  and  Use  of  Proceeds  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  and  Note  8  to  the  Financial

Financing

Our ﬁnancing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt
maturities, and to manage our net exposure to ﬂoating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to
minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided
us  with  ample  sources  of  liquidity.  Our  continued  access  to  these  markets  depends  on  multiple  factors,  including
the  condition  of  debt  capital  markets,  our  operating  performance,  and  maintaining  strong  credit  ratings.  As  of
July 29, 2023, our credit ratings were as follows:

Credit Ratings
Long-term debt
Commercial paper

Moody’s
A2
P-1

Standard and Poor’s
A
A-1

Fitch
A
F1

If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new
debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and
there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.

We  have  the  ability  to  obtain  short-term  ﬁnancing  from  time  to  time  under  our  commercial  paper  program  and
credit  facilities.  Our  committed  $1.0  billion  364-day  and  $3.0  billion  unsecured  revolving  credit  facilities  that  will
expire in October 2023 and October 2027, respectively, backstop our commercial paper program. No balances were
outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2023 or 2022. We did not have any balances outstanding
under our commercial paper program as of July 29, 2023, and we had $1.5 billion outstanding as of July 30, 2022.
Note 6 to the Financial Statements provides additional information.

Most  of  our  long-term  debt  obligations  contain  covenants  related  to  secured  debt  levels.  In  addition  to  a  secured
debt  level  covenant,  our  credit  facilities  also  contain  a  debt  leverage  covenant.  We  are,  and  expect  to  remain,  in
compliance  with  these  covenants.  Additionally,  as  of  July  29,  2023,  no  notes  or  debentures  contained  provisions
requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the
note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in
control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or
our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced
and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.

We  believe  our  sources  of  liquidity,  namely  operating  cash  ﬂows,  credit  facility  capacity,  and  access  to  capital
markets,  will  continue  to  be  adequate  to  meet  our  contractual  obligations,  working  capital  and  planned  capital
expenditures,  ﬁnance  anticipated  expansion  and  strategic  initiatives,  fund  debt  maturities,  pay  dividends,  and
execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.

New Accounting Pronouncements

We  do  not  expect  any  recently  issued  accounting  pronouncements  to  have  a  material  eﬀect  on  our  ﬁnancial
statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This  report  contains  forward-looking  statements,  which  are  based  on  our  current  assumptions  and  expectations.
These  statements  are  typically  accompanied  by  the  words  “expect,”  “may,”  “could,”  “believe,”  “would,”  “might,”
“anticipates,”  or  similar  words.  The  principal  forward-looking  statements  in  this  report  include:  our  ﬁnancial
performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the funding
of  debt  maturities,  the  execution  of  our  share  repurchase  program,  our  expected  capital  expenditures  and  new
lease  commitments,  the  expected  compliance  with  debt  covenants,  the  expected  impact  of  new  accounting
pronouncements,  our  intentions  regarding  future  dividends,  the  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  the  expected
outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for, claims, litigation, and the resolution of tax matters, and changes in
our assumptions and expectations.

All  such  forward-looking  statements  are  intended  to  enjoy  the  protection  of  the  safe  harbor  for  forward-looking
statements  contained  in  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  as  amended.  Although  we  believe
there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially diﬀerent. The
most important factors which could cause our actual results to diﬀer from our forward-looking statements are set
forth in our description of risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year
ended  January  28,  2023,  which  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  forward-looking  statements  in  this  report.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to
update any forward-looking statement.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There  have  been  no  material  changes  in  our  primary  risk  exposures  or  management  of  market  risks  from  those
disclosed  in  Part  II,  Item  7A,  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  About  Market  Risk  of  our  Form  10-K  for  the
ﬁscal year ended January 28, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During  the  most  recently  completed  ﬁscal  quarter,  there  were  no  changes  which  materially  aﬀected,  or  are
reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  quarterly  report,  we  conducted  an  evaluation,  under  supervision  and
with  the  participation  of  management,  including  the  chief  executive  oﬃcer  and  chief  ﬁnancial  oﬃcer,  of  the
eﬀectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief
executive oﬃcer and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are eﬀective at a
reasonable assurance level. Disclosure controls and procedures are deﬁned by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange  Act  as  controls  and  other  procedures  that  are  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be
disclosed  by  us  in  reports  ﬁled  with  the  SEC  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized,  and
reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without  limitation,  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  us  in
reports  ﬁled  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our
principal executive and principal ﬁnancial oﬃcers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
Based  on  my  knowledge,  the  ﬁnancial  statements,  and  other  ﬁnancial  information  included  in  this  report,

particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b. designed such internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, or caused such internal control over ﬁnancial

5.

The registrant’s other certifying oﬃcer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal

process, summarize and report ﬁnancial information; and

b. any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves  management  or  other  employees  who  have  a

signiﬁcant role in the registrant’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
