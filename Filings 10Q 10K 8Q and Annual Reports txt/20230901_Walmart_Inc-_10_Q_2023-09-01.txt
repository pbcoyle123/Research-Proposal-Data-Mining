Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Walmart Inc.

Note 1. Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Walmart" or the
"Company") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and do not contain certain information included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2023 ("ﬁscal 2023"). Therefore, the
interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a ﬁscal year ending January 31 for the
United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a
one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no signiﬁcant intervening events during the month of July
2023 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially aﬀected the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays,
as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the ﬁscal quarter
ending January 31.

Use of Estimates

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles
require management to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
Management's estimates and assumptions also aﬀect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results may diﬀer materially from those estimates.

Supplier Financing Program Obligations

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50):
Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier
ﬁnance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The Company adopted this ASU as of February 1,
2023, other than the roll-forward disclosure requirement which the Company will adopt in ﬁscal 2025.

The Company has supplier ﬁnancing programs with ﬁnancial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the
ﬁnancial institution the stated amount of conﬁrmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers.
Participation in these programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the
arrangement directly with the ﬁnancial institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these
programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due. The payment terms that the Company has with
participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 and 90 days. The Company does not
have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct ﬁnancial relationship with the
ﬁnancial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating ﬁnancial
institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects
to receive early payment from the ﬁnancial institution. The outstanding payment obligations to ﬁnancial institutions
under these programs were $5.3 billion, $5.2 billion and $6.4 billion, as of July 31, 2023, January 31, 2023 and
July 31, 2022, respectively. These obligations are generally classiﬁed as accounts payable within the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is classiﬁed as an operating activity within the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share

Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares
outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on
the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive eﬀect of
share-based awards. The Company did not have signiﬁcant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive
and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three
and six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and
diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart:

Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt

The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper
program. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0
billion as well as its ﬁve-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the
U.S. of $15.0 billion at July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, all undrawn.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

•

•

•

Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable;
and

Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to
develop its own assumptions.

The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments,
on a recurring basis within other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The fair value of these investments is as follows:

Changes in fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the
Company has elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other gains and
losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain other
immaterial investment activity, resulted in net gains of $3.2 billion and $36 million for the three and six months
ended July 31, 2023, respectively, and a net gain of $0.8 billion and a net loss of $1.2 billion for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. These fair value changes were primarily due to net changes in the
underlying stock prices of those investments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are
carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivatives

The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the
Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.
The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant
interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, the notional amounts
and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

(Amounts in millions)
Receive ﬁxed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities
are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities
resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of July 31, 2023 in the Company's Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Other Fair Value Disclosures

The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying
values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.

The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on
the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value
and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, are as follows:

Note 6. Contingencies

Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a
liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is
reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into
discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes
settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.

Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company,
individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's ﬁnancial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows.

Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation

During ﬁscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework
(described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. The Settlement Framework
includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has
substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation.

In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits ﬁled
against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiﬀs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native
American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of
widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate
Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The
Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL.

Similar cases that name the Company also have been ﬁled in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments,
healthcare providers, and other plaintiﬀs. Plaintiﬀs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been
responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to
nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.

On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to ﬁnancial amounts and payment terms to resolve
substantially all opioids-related lawsuits ﬁled against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native
American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below)
or in state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political
subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $3.1 billion (the "Settlement Amount"). The
Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also
includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement
framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political
subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies
for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the "Settlement
Framework."

The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political
subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and
political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or
otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company
announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with
the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories (the "Settling
States"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. On August 22, 2023, the
settlement administrator determined that a suﬃcient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in
the Settlement Framework, which was a necessary condition for the Settlement Framework to become eﬀective.
The Settlement Framework will become eﬀective 15 days later, on September 6, 2023. The Company is required to
deposit up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States within 15 days following
the eﬀective date of the Settlement Framework, which the Company expects to pay during the ﬁscal quarter ending
October 31, 2023. Although the settlement administrator has determined a suﬃcient number of political
subdivisions have agreed to participate in the State Settlement Framework, and thus the State Settlement
Framework will become eﬀective, eligible political subdivisions still have until July 15, 2025 to join the State
Settlement Framework.

Through July 2023, the Company has paid approximately $0.6 billion in the aggregate for separate settlements with
Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, Florida, West Virginia, and Alabama, as well as various Native American tribes
(excluding Cherokee Nation) that agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims
foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. Of the original approximately $3.3 billion accrued liability for the
Settlement Framework and other settlements, approximately $2.8 billion remains and is recorded in accrued
liabilities within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2023.

Other Opioid-Related Litigation

The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise
resolved by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any
other actions ﬁled by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers; and any action ﬁled by a political
subdivision or Native American tribe that is not resolved by the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company
has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any
loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope
and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, ﬁnancial position, results of operations or
cash ﬂows will not be materially adversely aﬀected.

Two-County Trial and MDL Bellwethers; and Canada. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the
MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, ﬁnding in favor of the plaintiﬀs as to the liability of all
defendants, including

12

Table of Contents

the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that
ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion
over ﬁfteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiﬀs injunctive relief. On September 7,
2022, the Company ﬁled an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is
stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into eﬀect on February 20, 2023.

The MDL designated ﬁve additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however,
these ﬁve counties have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement
Amount rather than go to trial. The MDL may designate additional bellwethers of cases brought by healthcare
providers and third-party payers.

Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in two
putative class action complaints ﬁled in Canada related to dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.
These matters remain pending.

DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") ﬁled a civil complaint
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled
substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The
complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil
penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021.
After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ ﬁled an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022,
the Company ﬁled a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.

Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two
securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with
respect to opioids, ﬁled in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5,
2021, purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through
December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants ﬁled a motion to
dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9,
2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiﬀs to ﬁle an amended complaint, which was ﬁled on October
14, 2022, and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from
March 31, 2017 through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants ﬁled a motion to dismiss the
amended complaint. That motion remains pending.

Derivative actions were also ﬁled by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021, alleging breach of ﬁduciary duties against certain of its current
and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also
alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current
oﬃcers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending
developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders ﬁled a derivative
action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board of Directors and
certain former oﬃcers breached their ﬁduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription
opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the
plaintiﬀs responded by ﬁling an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants
moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April
12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving
the Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to
stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") appointed an independent
Special Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former oﬃcers
and directors named in the various derivative proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board
has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate
in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC
completes its investigation.

Other Legal Proceedings

Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal
value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United
Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the
United Kingdom (the "Asda Equal Value Claims"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the
divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these
claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide
indemniﬁcation with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company
cannot predict the number of such claims that may be ﬁled, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of
loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the
scope and outcome of these matters.
Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United
States Attorney's Oﬃce for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding
the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the
Company's money transfer services,

where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company continues to
cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to
civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the
FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent.
On June 28, 2022, the FTC ﬁled a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule
regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August
29, 2022, the Company ﬁled a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the
motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company ﬁled its reply. On March 27, 2023, the Court issued an opinion
dismissing the FTC's claim under the Telemarketing Sales Rule and denying Walmart's motion to dismiss the claim
under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. On April 12, 2023, Walmart ﬁled a motion to certify the
Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal. The FTC's response to Walmart's motion to certify an
interlocutory appeal was ﬁled on May 8, 2023; Walmart ﬁled its reply on May 18, 2023. On June 30, 2023, the FTC
ﬁled an amended complaint against Walmart again asserting claims under the Federal Trade Commission Act and
Telemarketing Sales Rule. Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was ﬁled on August 11, 2023; the
FTC's response is due on September 15, 2023; and Walmart's reply is due on October 9, 2023. On July 20, 2023, the
Court denied Walmart's motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal, ﬁnding that it
would be more orderly to consider a request for interlocutory appeal after a ruling on Walmart's motion to dismiss
the amended complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can
provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or
range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, ﬁnancial
position, results of operations or cash ﬂows will not be materially adversely aﬀected.

Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue

Segments

The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites,
located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's
operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The
Company deﬁnes its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM")
regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and
services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual
products and services.

The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce,
which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business oﬀerings such as advertising services through
Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as
well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership
clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of
corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.

The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and
operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises
the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead
allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a
segment signiﬁcantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassiﬁed to be comparable to the
current period's presentation.

In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From
time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category.
When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassiﬁed to be comparable to the current period's
presentation.

In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales,
where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulﬁlled through a store or club.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s ("Walmart," the "Company," "our," or "we") results for periods
occurring in the ﬁscal year ending January 31, 2024 ("ﬁscal 2024") and the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2023
("ﬁscal 2023"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for
the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
January 31, 2023, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31,
2023.

We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our ﬁnancial
statements, the changes in certain key items in those ﬁnancial statements from period to period and the primary
factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to
assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the ﬁnancial results of
each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and
its results of operations aﬀect the ﬁnancial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.

Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss
segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the
results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead
allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating
income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision
maker.

Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing
stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the
corresponding prior year period. Walmart's deﬁnition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open
for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce
sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel
transactions which are fulﬁlled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business oﬀerings that are part
of our strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are
excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion
that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than ﬁve percent. Sales related to divested
businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such
acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others
within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result,
our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies.

In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use
to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars.
We calculate the eﬀect of changes in currency exchange rates as the diﬀerence between current period activity
translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency
exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until
owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of
currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net
sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.

Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results diﬀerently. Each, however, has generally
maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent
years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to ﬂuctuations
in currency exchange rates.

We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong
sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and
supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses and companies that oﬀer services in digital advertising, fulﬁllment
and delivery services, health and wellness, and ﬁnancial services. Many of these competitors are national, regional
or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with
a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates"). We, along with other retail
companies, are inﬂuenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and
other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income,
consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory
management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations, customer preferences, deﬂation,
inﬂation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and
costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariﬀs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.

We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by
everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have experienced continued inﬂation that impacts our
merchandise costs. The impact to our net sales and gross proﬁt margin is inﬂuenced in part by our pricing and
merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to:
absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing
prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when
necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not
limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on
private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating
purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may
continue to impact gross proﬁt as a percentage of net sales.

Further information on the factors that can aﬀect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an
investment in our securities can be found herein under "Item 5. Other Information."

We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inﬂation, a
challenging macro environment, geopolitical conditions, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends
and consumer conﬁdence. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to
"Results of Operations" below.

Company Performance Metrics

We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by
everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive
positions in the countries in which we operate.  We deﬁne our ﬁnancial priorities as follows:

• Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;

• Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and

business mix; and

•

Returns - improve our Return on Investment ("ROI") through margin improvement and disciplined capital
spend.

Growth

Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to
shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through
increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion
of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.

Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the
change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the
corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail
calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales
using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below,
we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our ﬁscal calendar, which may result in
diﬀerences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S.
as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency,
one inﬂationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.

Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023 and
2022, were as follows:

Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.9% and 5.9% for the three and six months ended July 31,
2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had
comparable sales growth of 5.9% and 6.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, driven
by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well as elevated inﬂation
impacts in certain merchandise categories, combined with growth in transactions. The increases were partially
oﬀset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales
positively contributed approximately 2.5% and 2.6% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July
31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery.

Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment decreased 0.2% and increased 2.1% for the three and six months
ended July 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in comparable sales for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was
primarily due to lower fuel sales from deﬂation in this category, oﬀset by growth in merchandise sales, which
beneﬁted from growth in transactions and average ticket and included elevated inﬂation impacts on certain
merchandise categories. Growth in comparable sales for the six months ended July 31, 2023 beneﬁted from growth
in average ticket and transactions and included elevated inﬂation impacts in certain merchandise categories,
partially oﬀset by lower fuel sales due to deﬂation in this category. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales
positively contributed approximately 1.8% and 1.7% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended
July 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home.

Margin

Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a
combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and
process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs, and we operate with
discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the eﬃciency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of
businesses, including the expansion of connected value streams with higher margins, such as advertising. Our
objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we deﬁne as growing operating income at a faster rate
than net sales.

Gross proﬁt as a percentage of net sales ("gross proﬁt rate") increased 50 and 17 basis points for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The
increases were primarily due to the lapping of higher markdowns and supply chain costs incurred in the previous
year and managing prices to reﬂect elevated cost inﬂation, partially oﬀset by product mix shifts into lower margin
categories globally.

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 and decreased 10 basis points for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due
to higher variable pay, technology and remodel costs in the U.S. and an incremental expense related to the opioid
settlement, partially oﬀset by strong ﬁxed cost leverage in most of our international markets. The decrease for the
six months ended July 31, 2023 was driven by higher sales in each of our segments as well as operating discipline.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 3 and 18 basis points for the three and six months ended
July 31, 2023, respectively, due to the factors described above.

Returns

As we execute our strategic priorities, focusing on high return investments that drive operating leverage, we
believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment
and free cash ﬂow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which
are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

Return on Assets and Return on Investment

We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our ﬁnancial statements
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP") and Return on
Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure,
management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how
eﬀectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-
term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.6% and 5.8% for the trailing twelve months
ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in average total
assets driven by higher purchases of property and equipment. ROI was 12.8% and 13.8% for the trailing twelve
months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROI was the result of a decrease in operating
income primarily due to opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded in Q3 and Q4 of
ﬁscal 2023 respectively, as well as an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of
property and equipment.

We deﬁne ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and
amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.
We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average
accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that
period.

18

Table of Contents

Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure because we calculate ROI using ﬁnancial
measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP
ﬁnancial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported
operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to
be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.
ROI diﬀers from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the
period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and
adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more
accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although
ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the
method used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to
calculate their ROI.

The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable
GAAP ﬁnancial measure, is as follows:

Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow,
which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial
measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be considered in
addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash
provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of
GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash
used in ﬁnancing activities.

We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and
equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion for the six months
ended July 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $9.0 billion when compared to the same period in the prior
year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free
cash ﬂow for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was $9.0 billion, which represents an increase of $7.2 billion when
compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating
cash ﬂows described above, partially oﬀset by an increase of $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our
investment strategy.

Walmart's deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for
discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt
service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is
important to view free cash ﬂow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Although other companies report their free cash ﬂow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's
free cash ﬂow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may diﬀer from the
methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash ﬂow.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow, a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, to net cash provided
by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP ﬁnancial measure most directly comparable to free cash
ﬂow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in ﬁnancing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income,
increased $8.8 billion or 5.7% and $19.5 billion or 6.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increase in revenue for the three
months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. segment,
which were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well as
elevated inﬂation impacts in certain merchandise categories, combined with growth in transactions. Additionally,
most of our international markets had positive comparable sales. Net sales were positively impacted by $0.6 billion
of ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates and negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel sales of $1.0 billion in the
Sam's Club segment primarily due to deﬂation in this category.

The increase in revenue for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to strong positive comparable
sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, which were driven by growth in average ticket, including
strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well as elevated inﬂation impacts in certain merchandise
categories, combined with growth in transactions. Additionally, most of our international markets had positive
comparable sales. Net sales were positively impacted by $0.3 billion of ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates and
negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel sales of $1.4 billion in the Sam's Club segment primarily due to deﬂation
in this category.

Gross proﬁt rate increased 50 and 17 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively,
when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increases were primarily due to the lapping of
higher markdowns and supply chain costs incurred in the previous year and managing prices to reﬂect elevated
cost inﬂation, partially oﬀset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories globally.

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 and decreased 10 basis points for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The
increase for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher variable pay, technology and
remodel costs in the U.S. and an incremental expense related to the opioid settlement, partially oﬀset by strong
ﬁxed cost leverage in most of our international markets. The decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was
driven by higher sales in each of our segments as well as operating discipline.

Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our
investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can ﬂuctuate from period to period.
The net increases of $3.7 billion and $2.7 billion in other gains for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year, were primarily due to increases in net
gains from changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments driven by net increases in their underlying
stock prices.

Our eﬀective income tax rate was 24.9% and 25.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively,
compared to 22.5% and 24.0% for the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increase in the eﬀective tax
rate was primarily due to a ﬁscal 2023 non-recurring rate beneﬁt from the gain recognized on the sale of our
remaining equity method investment in Brazil, which provided minimal realizable tax expense, and a discrete
beneﬁt for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, partially oﬀset by the tax impact on changes in fair value
of our investments. Our eﬀective income tax rate may ﬂuctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors
including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law,
outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S.
operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be diﬀerent than the U.S.
statutory rate.

As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion for the

three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which included stronger results from our Walmex
operations. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $2.92 and $3.54 for the
three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which represents respective increases of $1.04 and $0.93

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $5.7 billion or 5.4% and $12.7 billion or 6.3% for the three and
six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The
increases were due to comparable sales of 5.9% and 6.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023,
respectively, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well
as elevated inﬂation impacts in certain merchandise categories, combined with growth in transactions. The
increases were partially oﬀset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's
eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.5% and 2.6% to comparable sales for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery.

Gross proﬁt rate increased 40 and 2 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively,
when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the lapping
of higher markdowns and supply chain costs incurred in the previous year and managing prices to reﬂect elevated
cost inﬂation, partially oﬀset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories.

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 28 basis points and decreased 16 basis points for three
and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year.
The increase for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher variable pay, elevated
technology spend and higher costs related to store remodels. The decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2023
was primarily due to strong sales growth, partially oﬀset by higher variable pay.

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion and $1.0 billion for the three and
six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year.

We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the eﬀect of the Sam's Club

segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to
impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased $0.1 billion or 0.3% and increased $0.8 billion or 1.9% for the
three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal
year. The decrease for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in fuel sales of $1.0
billion due to deﬂation in this category. Net sales excluding fuel increased $0.9 billion primarily due to increased
merchandise sales, which beneﬁted from growth in average transactions and ticket and included elevated inﬂation
impacts on certain merchandise categories. The increase for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was driven by an
increase in comparable sales, including fuel, of 2.1%. Growth in comparable sales for the six months ended July 31,
2023 beneﬁted from growth in average ticket and transactions and included elevated inﬂation impacts in certain
merchandise categories, partially oﬀset by lower fuel sales due to deﬂation in this category. Net sales were
negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel sales of $1.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023. Sam's Club
eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.8% and 1.7% to comparable sales for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home.

Gross proﬁt rate increased 135 and 88 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively,
when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increases in gross proﬁt rate were primarily
due to the lapping of higher supply chain costs and inventory write-downs in the previous year. The three months
ended July 31, 2023 also increased due to the lapping of a larger inﬂation related LIFO charge recorded in the
previous year.

Membership and other income increased 6.9% and 5.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increases were due to growth in
our membership base, Plus penetration and renewals.

Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 107 and 79 basis points for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year, primarily
driven by lower fuel sales, elevated technology spend and higher facilities costs.

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion for both the three and six
months ended July 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous ﬁscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a signiﬁcant source of liquidity. Our
cash ﬂows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have
been suﬃcient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of
our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash ﬂow has been used to fund dividends on our
common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be suﬃcient to fund
operations, ﬁnance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the
next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion as compared to $9.2 billion for the six months ended
July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and
timing of certain payments.

Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deﬁcit

Cash and cash equivalents was $13.9 billion at both July 31, 2023 and 2022. Our working capital deﬁcit was $17.2
billion as of July 31, 2023, which increased when compared to the $15.7 billion working capital deﬁcit as of July 31,
2022, primarily driven by a decrease in inventories, as described above and an increase in accrued liabilities,
partially oﬀset by a decrease in short-term borrowings. We generally operate with a working capital deﬁcit due to
our eﬃcient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our
shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.

As of July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively,
may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the
noncontrolling interest shareholders.

Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt,
dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are
also classiﬁed as cash ﬂows used in ﬁnancing activities. Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities was $3.3 billion as
compared to $1.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net cash
used in ﬁnancing activities is primarily due to decreases in short-term borrowings, the purchase of certain
noncontrolling interests and payments of long-term debt, partially oﬀset by proceeds received from the issuance of
long-term debt in ﬁscal 2024 and fewer repurchases of Company stock.

In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as
well as its ﬁve-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion
at July 31, 2023, all undrawn.

During the six months ended July 31, 2023, our total outstanding long-term debt increased $0.9 billion primarily
due to the issuance of new long-term debt in April 2023, partially oﬀset by the maturities of certain long-term debt.

Dividends

Eﬀective February 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the ﬁscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an
increase over the ﬁscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For ﬁscal 2024, the annual dividend was or will be
paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:

The dividend installments payable on April 3, 2023 and May 30, 2023 were paid as scheduled.

Company Share Repurchase Program

From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs
authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2023
were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no
expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of
July 31, 2023, authorization for $18.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.
Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share
repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our
results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share
repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash ﬂow. The following table provides, on a
settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022:

During the six months ended July 31, 2023, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart
noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe.
Additionally, during the six months ended July 31, 2023, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of
equity funding for the Company's majority-owned PhonePe subsidiary.

Material Cash Requirements

Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related
costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisﬁed by our cash
from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include opioid and
other legal settlements, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase
obligations.

Capital Resources

We believe our cash ﬂows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital
markets will continue to be suﬃcient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which
includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions,
dividend payments and share repurchases.

We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us
to reﬁnance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of July 31, 2023, the ratings
assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:

Rating agency
Standard & Poor's
Moody's Investors Service
Fitch Ratings

A-1+
P-1

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each
agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit
ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could aﬀect our credit ratings include changes in our
operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our ﬁnancial position,
including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit
ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital
and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term
credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same ﬂexibility that we
have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt
ﬁnancing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or
debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is speciﬁc to
the security to which it applies.

Other Matters

In Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies" and appears in
Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Financial Statements," we discuss, under the
sub-captions "Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation," and
"Other Opioid-Related Litigation," the Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, and other matters,
including certain risks arising therefrom. In Note 6, we also discuss, under the sub-caption "Asda Equal Value
Claims" the Company's indemniﬁcation obligation for the Asda Equal Value Claims matter as well as under the sub-
caption "Money Transfer Agent Services Matters" a United States Federal Trade Commission complaint related to
money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program and a government investigation by the U.S. Attorney's
Oﬃce for the Middle District of Pennsylvania into the Company's consumer fraud prevention and anti-money
laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer agent services. We discuss various legal
proceedings related to the Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation and
Opioids-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation; Asda Equal Value Claims; and Money Transfer
Agent Services Litigation in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Legal
Proceedings," under the sub-caption "I. Supplemental Information." We also discuss items related to the Foreign
Direct Investment matter in India in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Legal
Proceedings," under the sub-caption "II. Certain Other Matters." We also discuss an environmental matter with the
State of California in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Legal Proceedings,"
under the sub-caption "III. Environmental Matters." The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in
the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their ﬁnal resolution.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and
the fair value of certain equity investments. As of July 31, 2023, there were no material changes to our market risks
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2023. The information concerning
market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended January 31,
2023, as ﬁled with the SEC on March 17, 2023, under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk," is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a
timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and
procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those
entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we
maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and make changes to our
systems and processes to improve such controls and increase eﬃciency, while ensuring that we maintain an
eﬀective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more eﬃcient
systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating
certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. In the ﬁrst quarter of
ﬁscal 2024, we began implementing a new ﬁnancial system, including our general ledger, in stages beginning in
our U.S. and Canadian markets. This ﬁnancial system is a signiﬁcant component of our internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of our new ﬁnancial system in stages, and
each implementation will impact our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

An evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer. Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
eﬀective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it ﬁles or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and are eﬀective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods speciﬁed by the SEC's rules and forms.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred
during the ﬁscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, that has materially aﬀected, or is reasonably likely to materially
aﬀect, the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain
regulatory matters, including responding to subpoenas and requests for information in connection with government
investigations. We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the
caption "Item 1. Financial Statements," in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
captioned "Contingencies," under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings." We refer you to that discussion for
important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known,
the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the
name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the
lawsuit was ﬁled.

Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The
MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of
August 18, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of
parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23,
2021, ﬁnding in favor of the plaintiﬀs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement
phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants,
including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over ﬁfteen years, on a joint and
several liability basis, and granted the plaintiﬀs injunctive relief. The Company has ﬁled an appeal with the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion
of the judgment went into eﬀect on February 20, 2023. The MDL designated ﬁve additional single-county cases as
bellwethers to proceed through discovery, though those bellwether plaintiﬀs have elected to participate in the
Settlement Framework. The MDL may designate additional bellwethers of cases brought by healthcare providers
and third-party payers. In addition, there are approximately 140 other cases pending in state and federal courts
throughout the country as of August 18, 2023, as well as other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and
certain other subsidiaries of the Company. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable,
are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a
Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits ﬁled against the Company by states,
political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that
previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S.
territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local
governments against the Company. As described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Settlement Framework will become eﬀective on September 6, 2023.

DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has
been ﬁled by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of
the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et
al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company ﬁled a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021.
After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ ﬁled an amended complaint on October
7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company ﬁled a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion
remains pending.

Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two
securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been ﬁled in Delaware naming
the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former oﬃcers as defendants. The
plaintiﬀs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the
defendants breached their ﬁduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and
that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's
disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been ﬁled in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and
those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative
suit has been ﬁled in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the
Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiﬀs
responded by ﬁling an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to
dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the
Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company' s
distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the
litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation
Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former oﬃcers and directors
named in the various proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to
retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties.
The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its
investigation.

The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the
Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be ﬁled on behalf of a class of investors who acquired
Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in
Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiﬀ and lead counsel. The defendants moved to
dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiﬀs ﬁled an
amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock
from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the
amended complaint. That motion remains pending.

II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS
Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause
notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and
individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the
recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and
regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from
2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial
stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage,
lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is
determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary
and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses
to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend
against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to
predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the ﬁnal outcome of the resulting
proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse eﬀect on
its business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations or cash ﬂows, the Company can provide no assurance as to
the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the
Company may receive in indemniﬁcation from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the
2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no
assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse eﬀect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental
matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential
monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1
million.

In December 2021, the Oﬃce of the Attorney General of the State of California ﬁled suit against the Company,
bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California
facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was ﬁled in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case
No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company
believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot
predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million.
Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse eﬀect on its business,
ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash ﬂows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and
outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse eﬀect to its business or its
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in
Part I, Item 1A, under the caption "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended
January 31, 2023, which risks could materially and adversely aﬀect our business, results of operations, ﬁnancial
condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk
factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be aﬀected by additional
factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our
business operations could also be aﬀected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S.
and globally. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs
authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended July 31,
2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has
no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of
July 31, 2023, authorization for $18.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.
Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to
execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of
borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase
program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended July 31, 2023, was as follows:

kind,  whether  known  or  unknown,  that  arose  up  to  and  including  the  date  the  Associate  signs  this
Agreement (including claims arising out of or relating to the termination of the Associate’s employment
with  Walmart),  including  claims  arising  under  the  laws  of  foreign  jurisdictions.  For  illustration  purposes
and  not  as  a  limitation,  the  claims  the  Associate  is  releasing  include  any  claims  for  damages,  costs,
attorneys’  fees,  expenses,  compensation  or  any  other  monetary  recovery.  Further,  the  Associate
speciﬁcally  waives  and  releases  all  claims  she  may  have  that  arose  up  to  and  including  the  date  the

b) Release of Age Discrimination Claims. With respect to the Associate’s release and waiver of claims
under  the  ADEA  as  described  in  Section  5(a)  above,  the  Associate  agrees  and  acknowledges  the
following:

(i)

The  Associate  has  reviewed  this  Agreement  carefully  and  understands  its  terms  and  conditions.
The  Associate  has  been  advised,  and  by  this  Agreement  is  again  advised,  to  consult  with  an
attorney of the Associate’s choice prior to entering into this Agreement.

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

The  Associate  shall  have  twenty-one  (21)  days  from  receipt  of  this  Agreement  to  consider  and
execute  the  Agreement  by  fully  executing  it  below  and  returning  it  to  Walmart;  otherwise,  the
terms  and  provisions  of  this  Agreement  become  null  and  void.  The  Associate  agrees  that  any
modiﬁcations,  material  or  otherwise,  made  to  this  Agreement  do  not  restart  or  aﬀect  in  any
manner the original review period.

The Associate will have a period of seven (7) calendar days after Associate signs the Agreement
during  which  to  revoke  the  Agreement.  The  Associate  must  provide  written  notice  of  revocation
during  the  seven  (7)  day  period  to  Kim  Lupo,  Senior  Vice  President,  Global  Total  Rewards.  Any
revocation within this period must expressly state, “I hereby revoke my Agreement.” The written
revocation must be delivered to Kim Lupo, Senior Vice President, Global Total Rewards, or to her
successor, and be postmarked within seven (7) calendar days of the Associate’s execution of this
Agreement. This Agreement will not become eﬀective or enforceable until the revocation period
has expired. If the last day of the revocation period is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then
the revocation period will not expire until the next following day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday.

The Associate knows that she is waiving her rights under the ADEA and does so voluntarily. The
Associate  realizes  the  waiver  does  not  include  any  ADEA  rights  which  may  arise  after  the
Associate signs this Agreement. By signing this Agreement, the Associate acknowledges that she
is receiving consideration that the Associate would not otherwise be entitled to receive.

No  transition  payments  or  acceleration  of  equity  pursuant  to  Section  3  of  this  Agreement  shall
occur  or  be  eﬀective  until  after  (1)  the  Associate  has  executed  and  delivered  this  Agreement  to
Walmart,  (2)  the  above-mentioned  seven-day  revocation  period  has  expired,  and  (3)  the
Associate  has  separated  from  employment  with  Walmart  as  set  forth  in  Section  1  of  this
Agreement.

c) Limitation  of  Release.  Nothing  in  this  Agreement  releases  or  impairs  claims  for  workers’
compensation  or  unemployment  beneﬁts.  Nothing  in  this  Agreement  prevents  Associate  from  pursuing
administrative  claims  with  or  otherwise  assisting  government  agencies,  including  engaging  in  or
participating  in  an  investigation  or  proceeding  conducted  by,  or  providing  information  to,  the  EEOC,
NLRB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any federal, state or local agency charged with the
enforcement  of  employment  or  other  laws.  Associate  acknowledges  and  agrees,  however,  that  the
transition  payments  set  forth  in  Section  3  of  this  Agreement  are  in  full  satisfaction  of  any  amounts  to
which  the  Associate  might  be  entitled  from  any  claim  against  Walmart,  and  that,  as  a  result  of  this
release and waiver of claims, the Associate is not entitled to receive any additional individual monetary
relief  from  Walmart.  This  release  and  waiver  of  claims  will  not  apply  to  rights  or  claims  that  may  arise
after  the  eﬀective  date  of  this  Agreement.  This  Agreement  is  not  intended  to  release  and  does  not
release or include claims that the law states cannot be waived by private agreement, nor does it prevent
the Associate from receiving any whistleblower or similar award. Nothing in this subparagraph or in this
Agreement is intended to limit or restrict any rights the Associate may have to enforce this Agreement or
challenge  the  Agreement’s  validity  under  the  ADEA,  or  any  other  right  that  cannot,  by  express  and
unequivocal  terms  of  law,  be  limited,  waived,  or  extinguished  by  settlement.  Further,  nothing  in  this
Agreement  is  intended  to  waive,  release  of  impair  the  Associate’s  right  to  vested  beneﬁts  under  any
Walmart-sponsored beneﬁt plan or program. In addition, nothing in this Agreement is intended to release
or  impair  any  rights  to  indemniﬁcation,  advancement  or  reimbursement  of  expenses,  or  insurance
coverage  available  to  Associate  as  an  oﬃcer,  director  or  employee  of  Walmart  (including  Walmart’s
director  and  oﬃcer  insurance  coverage),  including  without  limitation  under  Walmart’s  certiﬁcate  of
incorporation  and  bylaws  and  under  applicable  corporate  law  (including  without  limitation  to  the
maximum extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law).

d) Agreement  not  to  File  Suits.  By  signing  this  Agreement,  Associate  agrees  not  to  ﬁle  a  lawsuit  to
assert  any  claims  released  under  this  Section  5.  Associate  also  agrees  that  if  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction  makes  a  ﬁnal  determination  that  Associate  breached  this  provision,  Associate  will  be  liable
for all reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by any person against whom claims were released
under  Section  5(a)  resulting  from  such  action  and  shall  pay  all  reasonable  expenses  incurred  by  such
person in defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 5(d), together with any tax liability incurred
by  such  person  in  connection  with  the  receipt  of  such  amounts;  provided,  however,  that  the  person
against  whom  such  claims  were  released  provides  Associate  with  notice  of  his/her/its  intention  to  seek
payment of the amounts incurred in defending the proceeding at the onset of the defense. To the extent
that Associate is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be the prevailing party on any claims
in such action, Associate will not be liable for any costs, fees or expenses incurred by such person.

6. Conﬁdential  Information.  The  Associate  agrees  that  she  will  not  at  any  time,  whether  prior  to  or
subsequent  to  the  Separation  Date,  directly  or  indirectly  use  or  disclose  any  Conﬁdential  Information  (as
deﬁned  below)  obtained  during  the  course  of  her  employment  with  Walmart  or  otherwise,  except  as  (a)
previously authorized by Walmart in writing, (b) required by applicable legal proceeding, or (c) permitted by
Section  5(c)  or  18(a)  of  this  Agreement.  In  addition,  the  Associate  shall  not  disclose  any  information  for
which Walmart holds a legally recognized privilege against disclosure or discovery (“Privileged Information”),
or take any other action that would cause such privilege to be waived by Walmart. With respect to (b) above
only, and subject to Sections 5(c) and 18(a) hereof, in the event that the Associate is required by applicable
legal proceeding (including, without limitation, by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents,  subpoena,  civil  investigative  demand,  or  other  legal  proceeding)  to  disclose  any  Conﬁdential
Information or Privileged Information, the Associate shall provide Walmart with prompt prior written notice of
such requirement. The Associate shall also, to the extent legally permissible and again subject to Sections
5(c) and 18(a) hereof, provide Walmart as promptly as practicable with a description of the information that
may  be  required  to  be  disclosed  (and,  if  applicable,  the  text  of  the  disclosure  itself)  and  cooperate  with
Walmart  (at  Walmart’s  expense)  to  the  extent  Walmart  may  seek  to  limit  such  disclosure,  including,  if
requested,  by  taking  all  reasonable  steps  to  resist  or  narrow  any  such  disclosure  or  to  obtain  a  protective
order  or  other  remedy  with  respect  thereto.  If  a  protective  order  or  other  remedy  is  not  obtained  and
disclosure is legally required, the Associate shall (a) disclose such information only to the extent required in
the  written  opinion  of  the  Associate’s  legal  counsel,  and  (b)  give  advance  notice  to  Walmart  of  the
information  to  be  actually  disclosed  as  far  in  advance  as  is  reasonably  possible.  In  any  such  event,  the
Associate  and  her  legal  counsel  shall  use  reasonable  commercial  eﬀorts  to  ensure  that  all  Conﬁdential
Information or Privileged Information that is so disclosed is accorded conﬁdential treatment by the recipient
thereof.

“Conﬁdential  Information”  means  information  pertaining  to  the  business  of  Walmart,  and  includes,  without
limitation,  information  regarding  processes,  suppliers,  consultants  and  service  providers  (including  the
terms,  conditions,  or  other  business  arrangements  with  suppliers,  consultants  and  service  providers),
advertising,  marketing,  and  external  and  internal  communications  plans  and  strategies,  labor  matters  and
strategies,  government  relations  plans  and  strategies,  litigation  matters  and  strategies,  investigatory  and
compliance  information  and  strategies,  tax  matters  and  strategies,  community  relations  and  public  aﬀairs
plans  and  strategies,  charitable  giving  plans  and  strategies,  sustainability  plans  and  strategies,  proﬁt
margins,  seasonal  plans,  goals,  objectives,  projections,  compilations,  and  analyses  regarding  Walmart’s
business,  salary,  staﬃng,  compensation,  promotion,  diversity  objectives  and  other  employment-related
data, and any know-how, techniques, practices or non-public technical information regarding the business of
Walmart.  “Conﬁdential  Information”  does  not  include  information  that  is  or  becomes  generally  available  to
the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Associate or any of the Associate’s representatives or
information that Walmart has authorized the Associate to disclose.

As  requested  by  Walmart,  the  Associate  shall  return  to  Walmart  all  documents,  programs,  software,
equipment,  ﬁles,  statistics,  and  other  written  or  electronic  business  materials,  including  any  and  all  copies
both paper and electronic, concerning Walmart.

7. Cooperation.

a. Cooperation with Walmart. The Associate may from time to time after the Retirement Date be called
upon to testify or provide information to Walmart in connection with employment-related and other legal
proceedings  involving  Walmart.  The  Associate  will  provide  reasonable  assistance  to,  and  will  cooperate
with,  Walmart  in  connection  with  any  litigation,  arbitration,  investigations,  or  judicial  or  non-judicial
administrative proceedings that may exist or may subsequently arise regarding events about which the
Associate  has  knowledge,  and  will  testify  truthfully  in  any  such  proceedings.  If  the  assistance  is  at
Walmart’s request, Walmart will compensate the Associate for all reasonable costs and expenses.

b. Cooperation  with  Governmental  Authorities.  From  time  to  time,  Walmart  may  be  under
investigation by various governmental authorities. Walmart encourages the Associate to cooperate with
all  such  investigations.  If  such  assistance  is  requested  by  a  governmental  authority,  Walmart  shall
reimburse the Associate for all reasonable costs and expenses.

c. Board  Membership.  Eﬀective  as  of  the  Retirement  Date,  the  Associate  hereby  agrees,  at  Walmart’s
request, to resign from any boards of directors, boards of managers, and similar governing boards of any
Walmart entities of which the Associate may be a member, resigns as an oﬃcer of any and all Walmart
entities, resigns as Walmart’s representative on any external trade, industry or similar associations, and
agrees to sign any documents acknowledging such resignations, as may be requested by Walmart.

8. Non-disclosure, non-disparagement and non-solicitation. The Associate shall not directly or

indirectly: a) discuss or disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement with anyone, except as provided
below; b) make disparaging comments regarding Walmart, its business strategies and operations, and any of
Walmart’s oﬃcers, directors, associates, and shareholders, except that nothing herein shall prevent
Associate from providing truthful information and testimony to government authorities, nor shall it prevent
Associate from providing truthful information and testimony in any legal proceedings or as otherwise
required by law; or c) for a period of six (6) months following the Separation Date, solicit for employment
any employee of Walmart or its aﬃliates holding the title of (or in a position equivalent to) senior director,
vice president, senior vice president, or executive vice president. For purposes of clarity, the non-solicitation
restriction in this paragraph shall not apply to situations where a person independently, without solicitation
from the Associate, approaches and expresses interest in a position outside of Walmart or otherwise
responds independently to a publicly-posted position outside of Walmart.

The Associate agrees and understands that the terms of this Agreement are CONFIDENTIAL including the

existence, fact and terms of this Agreement and the fact that money was paid to the Associate. Except as
permitted by Sections 5(c ) or 18(a), the Associate warrants to have not disclosed the above to anyone prior
to signing and will not disclose to anyone the existence, fact and terms of this Agreement, except for the
Associate’s spouse, attorney, and ﬁnancial advisor, all of whom shall be informed of the conﬁdential nature
of this Agreement and agree to abide by its terms.

9. Code of Conduct and Compliance with Laws. The Associate has read and understands the provisions of
Walmart’s  Code  of  Conduct.  The  Associate  further  acknowledges  that  the  Associate  has  complied  with  the
applicable  Code  of  Conduct  during  the  Associate’s  employment.  The  discovery  of  a  failure  to  abide  by  the
Code of Conduct, whenever discovered, shall entitle Walmart to suspend and recoup any payments paid or
due under this Agreement or any other agreements between the parties.

10. Covenant  not  to  Compete.  Due  to  the  strategic,  sensitive  and  far-reaching  nature  of  the  Associate’s
current and former positions at Walmart and the Conﬁdential Information to which the Associate is and has
been exposed, Associate agrees, promises, and covenants that:

a) For a period of two (2) years from the date on which Associate’s employment with Walmart terminates,

and regardless of the cause or reason for such termination, Associate will not directly or indirectly:

(i) own,  manage,  operate,  ﬁnance,  join,  control,  advise,  consult,  render  services  to,  have  a  current  or
future interest in, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, ﬁnancing, or control of, or
be  employed  by  or  connected  in  any  manner  with,  any  Competing  Business  as  deﬁned  below  in
Section 10(b)(i), any Global Retail Business as deﬁned below in Section 10(b)(ii); and/or

(ii) participate  in  any  other  activity  that  risks  the  use  or  disclosure  of  Conﬁdential  Information  either
overtly by the Associate or inevitably through the performance of such activity by the Associate.

b) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i)

the  term  “Competing  Business”  shall  include  any  general  or  specialty  retail,  grocery,  wholesale
membership  club,  or  merchandising  business,  inclusive  of  its  respective  parent  companies,
subsidiaries  and/or  aﬃliates  that:  (a)  sells  goods  or  merchandise  at  retail  to  consumers  and/or
businesses  (whether  through  physical  locations,  via  the  internet  or  combined)  or  has  plans  to  sell
goods or merchandise at retail to consumers and/or businesses (whether through physical locations,
via the internet or combined) within twelve (12) months following Associate’s last day of employment
with Walmart in the United States; and (b) has gross annual consolidated sales volume or revenues
attributable to its retail operations (whether through physical locations, via the internet or combined)
equal to or in excess of U.S.D. $7 billion.

(ii) the  term  “Global  Retail  Business”  shall  include  any  general  or  specialty  retail,  grocery,  wholesale
membership  club,  or  merchandising  business,  inclusive  of  its  respective  parent  companies,
subsidiaries  and/or  aﬃliates,  that:  (a)  in  any  country  or  countries  outside  of  the  United  States  in
which Walmart conducts business or intends to conduct business in the twelve (12) months following
Associate’s last day of employment with Walmart, sells goods or merchandise at retail to consumers
and/or  businesses  (whether  through  physical  locations,  via  the  internet  or  combined);  and  (b)  has
gross  annual  consolidated  sales  volume  or  revenues  attributable  to  its  retail  operations  (whether
through physical locations, via the internet or combined) equal to or in excess of U.S.D. $7 billion in
any country pursuant to b(ii)(a) or in the aggregate equal to or in excess of U.S.D. $7 billion in any
countries  taken  together  pursuant  to  b(ii)(a)  when  no  business  in  any  one  country  has  annual
consolidated  sales  volume  or  revenues  attributable  to  its  retail  operations  equal  to  or  in  excess  of
U.S.D. $7 billion.

c)        Ownership  of  an  investment  of  less  than  the  greater  of  $25,000  or  1%  of  any  class  of  equity  or  debt
security  of  a  Competing  Business  and/or  a  Global  Retail  Business  will  not  be  deemed  ownership  or
participation in ownership of a Competing Business and/or a Global Retail Business for purposes of this
Agreement.

d)    The covenant not to compete set forth in this Section 10 shall bind associate and shall remain in full
force  and  eﬀect  regardless  of  whether  the  Associate  qualiﬁes  or  continues  to  remain  eligible  for  the
Transition Payments set forth in Section 3 above.

11. Aﬃrmation.  Other  than  may  be  provided  for  in  any  class  or  collective  action  that  was  pending  against
Walmart  as  of  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  the  Associate  states  and  acknowledges  that  she  has  been  paid
and/or received all leave (paid or unpaid), compensation, wages, bonuses, commissions, and/or beneﬁts to
which  she  may  be  entitled  and  that  no  other  leave  (paid  or  unpaid),  compensation,  wages,  bonuses,
commissions,  and/or  beneﬁts  are  due  her,  except  as  provided  for  in  this  Agreement.  The  Associate  also
states  and  conﬁrms  that  she  has  reported  to  Walmart  any  and  all  work-related  injuries  incurred  by  her
during her employment by Walmart. Further, Associate acknowledges that she has been properly provided
any  leave  of  absence  because  of  the  Associate’s  or  the  Associate’s  family  member’s  health  condition  and
has not been subjected to any improper treatment, conduct, or actions due to a request for or taking such
leave.  Additionally,  Associate  speciﬁcally  acknowledges  that  she  has  not  made  any  request  for  leave
pursuant  to  FMLA  which  was  not  granted;  and,  Walmart  has  not  interfered  in  any  way  with  Associate’s
eﬀorts to take leave pursuant to FMLA.

12. Advice of Counsel. The Associate has been advised, and by this Agreement is again advised, to consider
this  Agreement  carefully  and  to  review  it  with  legal  counsel  of  the  Associate’s  choice.  The  Associate
understands the provisions of this Agreement and has been given the opportunity to seek independent legal
advice before signing this Agreement.

13.    Non-Admission. The parties acknowledge that the terms and execution of this Agreement are the result
of negotiation and compromise, that this Agreement is entered into in good faith, and that this Agreement
shall  never  be  considered  at  any  time  or  for  any  purpose  as  an  admission  of  liability  by  Walmart  or  that
Walmart acted wrongfully with respect to the Associate, or any other person, or that the Associate has any
rights  or  claims  whatsoever  against  Walmart  arising  out  of  or  from  the  Associate’s  employment.  Walmart
speciﬁcally denies any liability to the Associate on the part of itself, its employees, its agents, and all other
persons and entities released herein.

14.    Return of Company Property. As soon as practical after the Retirement Date, the Associate will return
all Walmart-owned property including but not limited to computers, hand-held computing devices (e.g., iPad,
Surface, etc.), cell phones, videoconferencing equipment (e.g., Tandberg), documents, ﬁles, computer ﬁles,
keys, ID’s, credit cards, if any.

15.    Taxes. The Associate acknowledges and agrees that the Associate is responsible for paying all taxes and
related  penalties  and  interest  imposed  on  the  Associate  or  Walmart  (other  than  Walmart’s  portion  of  FICA
taxes)  with  respect  to  the  Associate’s  compensation  and  beneﬁts,  including  the  separation  payments  and
beneﬁts  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  (collectively,  the  “Taxes”).  Walmart  will  withhold  Taxes,  including  from
amounts or beneﬁts payable under this Agreement, and report them to tax authorities, as it determines it is
required to do so by law. Associate further acknowledges and agrees that Walmart is not responsible for the
determination  by  any  government  agency  on  the  tax  treatment  to  be  given  to  compensation  and  beneﬁts
granted under this Agreement, and the Associate hereby covenants and agrees to pay Walmart all Taxes due
in  connection  with  such  compensation  and  beneﬁts.  To  the  extent  applicable,  all  payments  under  this
Agreement  are  intended  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Section  409A,  and  Walmart  intends  to
administer this Agreement so that it will comply with Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Walmart
does not represent or warrant to the Associate that taxes and penalties will not be imposed under Section
409A  or  any  other  provision  of  federal,  state,  local,  or  non-United  States  law.  Further,  neither  Walmart  nor
any  of  its  directors,  oﬃcers,  employees  or  advisors  shall  be  liable  to  the  Associate  (or  any  other  person
claiming a beneﬁt through the Associate) for any Taxes the Associate may owe as a result of the Associate’s
compensation or beneﬁts, and shall have no obligation to indemnify or otherwise protect the Associate from
the obligation to pay any Taxes pursuant to Section 409A.

a) Tax Equalization Beneﬁts

(i) Walmart  agrees  to  continue  providing  the  Associate  with  tax  equalization  beneﬁts,  as  described  in
Walmart’s  Tax  Equalization  Policy,  for  so  long  a  time  as:  1)  the  Associate  receives  income  paid  by
Walmart related to her employment with Walmart while on international assignment; 2) the Associate
is  required  under  the  laws  of  the  United  Kingdom  to  ﬁle  a  personal  income  tax  return  or  remit  tax
regarding such income; and 3) the Associate settles all current and prior tax equalization obligations.
For clarity, any separation payments and beneﬁts provided under this Agreement in connection with
the  Associate’s  termination  are  not  considered  international  assignment  beneﬁts  and  are  therefore
not subject to tax equalization under the Tax Equalization Policy except to the extent of Tax Beneﬁts
utilized as discussed in subsection (b) below. These tax equalization beneﬁts will be paid on a timely
basis in accordance with IRS Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(b)(8)(iii).

(ii)

The  Associate  understands  that  if  the  Associate  fails  to  reimburse  Walmart  for  any  amounts  owed
pursuant  to  future  or  past  outstanding  tax  equalization  calculations  within  the  timeline  speciﬁed  in
the  Tax  Equalization  Policy,  any  such  amounts  may  be  deducted  from  any  salary,  allowances,
expenses,  end  of  assignment  bonuses,  separation  payments  or  other  compensation  or
reimbursements owed to the Associate by Walmart, and the Associate hereby authorizes Walmart to
make such deductions. The Associate further agrees to execute any documents required to facilitate
reimbursement of any amount owed to Walmart under the Global Assignment Policy.

b) Tax Beneﬁts. The Associate acknowledges that, during the Associate’s employment, Walmart provided
tax  equalization  beneﬁts  pertaining  to  Associate’s  international  assignment  and  that  the  provision  of
such  beneﬁts,  including  the  provision  of  such  beneﬁts  under  the  terms  of  section  (a)  above,  have
resulted  or  may  result  in  the  accrual  of  certain  U.S.  tax  beneﬁts  through  either  a  tax  credit  or  tax
deduction,  which  the  parties  acknowledge  are  the  result  of  assignment  related  payments  or
reimbursements  to  or  from  Walmart  and  are  the  rightful  property  of  Walmart.  The  Parties  agree  that
Walmart  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  use  any  such  tax  beneﬁts  to  oﬀset  any  tax  equalization  beneﬁts
otherwise due to Associate as described in this Section 15, or for any other purpose, which may result in
a reimbursement due back to Walmart from utilization of the tax beneﬁts.

c) Tax  Preparation  Services.  Walmart  will  provide,  at  Walmart’s  expense,  professional  tax  preparation
services  for  each  tax  year  in  which  either:  1)  the  Associate  is  subject  to  United  Kingdom  tax  ﬁling
requirements for assignment related compensation paid or reimbursed by Walmart that is eligible for tax
equalization  beneﬁts  under  Section  15(a),  herein;  or  2)  U.S.  tax  ﬁlings  require  reporting  of  such
assignment  related  compensation  and/or  allow  for  a  claim  of  tax  beneﬁts  that  are  the  property  of
Walmart,  as  described  in  Section  15(b),  herein;  and  the  associate  settles  all  current  and  prior  tax
equalization obligations. The choice of professional tax preparer will be made by Walmart.

d) Tax  Authority  Inquiries.  Walmart  will  also  provide,  at  Walmart’s  expense,  the  services  of  a
professional tax preparer to assist in the defense of any tax inquiries or audits related to the tax returns
prepared for the Associate by Walmart’s designated tax preparer under the Tax Equalization Policy. The
tax preparer beneﬁts provided under this paragraph shall be administered consistent with the following
requirements  as  set  forth  in  Treas.  Reg.  §1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv):  (1)  the  Associate's  eligibility  for  beneﬁts  in
one year will not aﬀect the Associate's eligibility for beneﬁts in any other year; (2) any reimbursement of
eligible  expenses  will  be  made  on  or  before  the  last  day  of  the  year  following  the  year  in  which  the
expense was incurred; and (3) the Associate's right to beneﬁts is not subject to liquidation or exchange
for another beneﬁt.

e) Representations.  The  Associate  makes  no  representations  as  to  the  taxability  or  appropriateness  of
the  amounts  paid  to  Associate  or  paid  by  the  Associate  to  Walmart  as  tax  equalization  beneﬁts  or
claimed as tax beneﬁts on tax returns. The Associate did not and will not make any decisions as to the
calculation of the tax equalization beneﬁts or tax beneﬁts belonging to Walmart, if any, as these beneﬁts
are  calculated  by  Walmart's  designated  tax  preparer.  Notwithstanding  the  duties  and  responsibilities
found  in  this  section  of  the  Agreement,  Walmart  agrees  to  indemnify  the  Associate  and  hold  her
harmless  from  any  interest,  taxes  or  penalties  assessed  against  Associate  by  any  state,  federal,
international  or  local  governmental  agency,  regulatory  agency,  or  tax  authority  as  a  result  of  the  tax
equalization  beneﬁts  and/or  tax  preparation  services  provided  by  Walmart  related  to  income  paid  by
Walmart  to  the  Associate.  This  indemniﬁcation  by  Walmart  to  the  Associate  survives  the  Associate’s
separation from employment with Walmart. For the avoidance of doubt, Walmart will not indemnify the
Associate  for  any  assessment  against  the  Associate  based  on  income  taxable  to  the  Associate  but  not
paid by Walmart.

16.        Remedies  for  Breach.  The  Parties  shall  each  be  entitled  to  pursue  all  legal  and  equitable  rights  and
remedies  to  secure  performance  of  their  respective  obligations  and  duties  under  this  Agreement,  and
enforcement  of  one  or  more  of  these  rights  and  remedies  will  not  preclude  the  Parties  from  pursuing  any
other rights or remedies. Associate acknowledges that a breach of the provisions of Sections 6 through 10
above  could  result  in  substantial  and  irreparable  damage  to  Walmart’s  business,  and  that  the  restrictions
contained in Sections 6 through 10 are a reasonable attempt by Walmart to safeguard its rights and protect
its  conﬁdential  information.  Associate  expressly  agrees  that  upon  a  breach  or  a  threatened  breach  of  the
provisions  of  Sections  6  through  10,  Walmart  shall  be  entitled  to  seek  injunctive  relief  to  restrain  such
violation. With respect to any breach of this Agreement by either Party as made by a ﬁnal determination by
a court of competent jurisdiction, the breaching Party agrees to indemnify and hold the non-breaching Party
harmless  from  and  against  any  and  all  loss,  cost,  damage,  or  expense,  including,  but  not  limited  to,
attorneys’ fees incurred by the non-breaching Party. In addition to any other remedies at law or at equity, if
at any time a court of competent jurisdiction makes a ﬁnal determination that the Associate failed to comply
with the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, the Associate acknowledges that Walmart is not
obligated to make any further Transition Payments to the Associate.

17.        Recoupment.  The  Associate  agrees  and  acknowledges  that  incentive  compensation  paid  or  granted
during  the  course  of  the  Associate’s  employment  with  Walmart  is  subject  to  the  recoupment  provisions  of
the  incentive  plans  under  which  such  incentive  compensation  was  paid  or  granted.  Furthermore,  in  the
event  that  Walmart  is  required  to  recoup  any  incentive  compensation  previously  paid  to  the  Associate
pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Act,  SEC  and/or  NYSE  rules  promulgated  thereunder,  and/or
Walmart  policies  adopted  pursuant  to  such  provisions  and  rules,  the  Associate  agrees  to  repay  such
amounts.

18.    Miscellaneous.

a) Protected  Rights.  Nothing  in  this  Agreement  is  intended  to  prohibit  the  Associate  from  engaging  in
any legally protected communication or action. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall restrict, limit
or  otherwise  modify  Associate’s  rights  under  Walmart’s  Open  Door  Policy.  Nothing  contained  in  this
Agreement  is  intended  to  discourage  the  Associate  from  reporting  any  activity  or  information  under
Walmart’s  Code  of  Conduct  or  to  a  governmental  agency  as  permitted  by  any  “whistleblower”  laws.
Associate  shall  not  be  held  criminally  or  civilly  liable  under  this  Agreement  or  any  other  agreement  or
any federal or state trade secret law for making any conﬁdential disclosure of a Walmart trade secret or
other conﬁdential information directly or indirectly to a government oﬃcial or an attorney for purposes of
reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or regulation, or in a complaint or other document
ﬁled  under  seal  in  a  lawsuit  or  other  proceeding,  nor  shall  Associate  be  required  to  obtain  approval  or
notify  Walmart  prior  to  making  any  such  disclosure.  The  foregoing  also  applies  speciﬁcally  to  an
Associate suing Walmart for retaliation, who may disclose a trade secret to his or her attorney and use
the  trade  secret  information  in  the  court  proceeding,  so  long  as  any  document  containing  the  trade
secret is ﬁled under seal and the individual does not disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court
order.

b) Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement,  along  with  the  most  recent  Non  Disclosure  and  Restricted  Use
Agreement executed by the Associate (the “Non-Disclosure Agreement”), contains the entire agreement
and  understanding  of  the  parties,  and  no  prior  statements  by  either  party  will  be  binding  unless
contained  in  this  Agreement  or  incorporated  by  reference  in  this  Agreement  or  the  Non-Disclosure
Agreement. The parties agree that no prior statements by either party will be binding unless contained in
this  Agreement  or  the  Non-Disclosure  Agreement.  In  addition,  to  be  binding  on  the  parties,  any
handwritten changes to this Agreement must be initialed and dated by the Associate and the authorized
representative  of  Walmart  whose  signature  appears  below.  This  Agreement  supercedes  and  speciﬁcally
terminates all prior agreements between the Associate and Walmart with respect to the subject matter
hereof,  including  the  Non-Competition  Agreement,  and  no  amounts  will  be  owed  or  payable  to  the
Associate under or pursuant to the Non-Competition Agreement.

c) Conﬂict  with  Exhibits.  If  the  terms  and  provisions  of  this  Agreement  conﬂict  with  the  terms  and

provisions of any exhibit to this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement will govern.

d) Severability. If any portion or provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, the
parties agree that the remaining portions will remain in full force and eﬀect. The parties will negotiate in
good faith to give such unenforceable or invalid provisions the eﬀect the parties intended.

e) Section  Titles.  Section  titles  are  informational  only  and  are  not  to  be  considered  in  construing  this

Agreement.

f) Successors  and  Assigns.  The  parties  acknowledge  that  this  Agreement  will  be  binding  on  their

respective successors, assigns, and heirs.

g) Governing  Law  and  Dispute  Resolution.  This  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by,  and  construed  in
accordance  with,  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  without  regard  to  Delaware  law  concerning  the
conﬂicts  of  law.  The  Parties  further  agree  that  any  action  relating  to  the  interpretation,  validity,  or
enforcement of this Agreement shall be brought in the of the courts of the State of Delaware, County of
New Castle, or in the United States District Court of Delaware, and the parties hereby expressly consent
to the jurisdiction of such courts and agree that venue is proper in those courts. The parties do hereby
irrevocably: (a) submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) agree to service of such
courts’  process  upon  them  with  respect  to  any  such  proceeding;  (c)  waive  any  objection  to  venue  laid
therein;  and  (d)  consent  to  service  of  process  by  registered  mail,  return  receipt  requested.  Associate
further agrees that in any claim or action involving the execution, interpretation, validity or enforcement
of this Agreement, Associate will seek satisfaction exclusively from the assets of Walmart and will hold
harmless Walmart’s individual directors, oﬃcers, employees, and representatives.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement on the date ﬁrst above written.
