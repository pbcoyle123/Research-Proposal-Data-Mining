Conversion Amount will be determined by the Reﬁnancing Amendment Left Lead Arranger in consultation with the
Borrower  and  all  such  determinations  (absent  manifest  error)  shall  be  ﬁnal,  conclusive  and  binding  on  the
Administrative  Agent,  the  Borrower,  the  Lenders  and  the  other  Secured  Parties,  and  none  of  the  Administrative

amount of such Converting Lender’s Existing Term Loans over its 2023 Other Term Commitment. For the avoidance
of doubt, if there is no such excess, the Non-Converting Portion with respect to such Converting Lender will be zero.
The Non-Converting Portion will be determined by the Reﬁnancing Amendment Left Lead Arranger in consultation
with the Borrower and all such determinations (absent manifest error) shall be ﬁnal, conclusive and binding on the
Administrative  Agent,  the  Borrower,  the  Lenders  and  the  other  Secured  Parties,  and  none  of  the  Administrative
Agent,  the  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  Left  Lead  Arranger  or  the  Borrower  (or  any  of  their  respective  Aﬃliates)  shall

pursuant to Section 3 hereof), (C) each reference to a “Tranche B Term Loan Commitment” in the Credit Agreement
(as  amended  pursuant  to  Section  3  hereof)  shall  be  deemed  to  refer  to,  and  constitute,  a  2023  Other  Term

(a)            Each  Guarantor  party  hereto  reaﬃrms  its  guarantee  of  the  Guaranteed  Obligations  (as

that  would  enable  such  Guarantor  to  avoid  or  delay  timely  performance  of  its  obligations  under  the  Loan
Documents  (except  to  the  extent  such  obligations  constitute  Excluded  Swap  Obligations  with  respect  to  such

to the terms and conditions of this Reﬁnancing Amendment and the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition,
each such Loan Party reaﬃrms the security interests granted by such Loan Party under the terms and conditions of
the Security Agreement to secure the Obligations and agrees that such security interests remain in full force and
eﬀect  and  are  hereby  ratiﬁed,  reaﬃrmed  and  conﬁrmed.  Each  such  Loan  Party  hereby  conﬁrms  that  the  security

which  it  is  a  party  or  to  which  it  is  otherwise  bound  and  all  Collateral  (as  deﬁned  in  the  Security  Agreement)
encumbered  thereby  will  continue  to  guarantee  or  secure,  as  the  case  may  be,  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  in
accordance  with  the  Loan  Documents,  the  payment  and  performance  of  the  Obligations,  as  the  case  may  be,
including  without  limitation,  the  payment  and  performance  of  all  such  applicable  Obligations  that  are  joint  and
several  obligations  of  each  such  Loan  Party  now  or  hereafter  existing,  (ii)  conﬁrms  its  respective  grant  to  the
Collateral Agent for the beneﬁt of the Secured Parties of the security interest in and continuing Lien on all of such
Loan Party’s right, title and interest in, to and under all Collateral (as deﬁned in the Security Agreement), whether
now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising and wherever located, as collateral security for the prompt
and  complete  payment  and  performance  in  full  when  due,  whether  at  stated  maturity,  by  required  prepayment,
declaration,  acceleration,  demand  or  otherwise,  of  all  applicable  Obligations  (including  all  such  Obligations  as
amended, reaﬃrmed and/or increased pursuant to this Reﬁnancing Amendment), subject to the terms contained in
the  applicable  Loan  Documents,  and  (iii)  subject  to  Section  6  of  this  Reﬁnancing  Amendment,  conﬁrms  its
respective guarantees, pledges, grants of security interests and other obligations, as applicable, under and subject
to the terms of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party.

Documents to which it is a party or to which it is otherwise bound shall continue in full force and eﬀect and that all
of its obligations thereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be impaired or limited by the execution or
eﬀectiveness of this Reﬁnancing Amendment.

SECTION  8           Counterparts.  This  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  may  be  executed  in  counterparts  (and  by
diﬀerent parties hereto in diﬀerent counterparts), each of which constitute an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery by facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission (i.e. a
“pdf”  or  “tif”)  of  an  executed  counterpart  of  a  signature  page  to  this  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  is  eﬀective  as
delivery  of  an  original  executed  counterpart  hereof  and  the  words  “execution,”  “execute”,  “signed,”  “signature,”
and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Reﬁnancing Amendment
shall  be  deemed  to  include  electronic  signatures,  the  electronic  matching  of  assignment  terms  and  contract
formations on electronic platforms reasonably approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in
electronic  form,  each  of  which  shall  be  of  the  same  legal  eﬀect,  validity  or  enforceability  as  a  manually  executed
signature or the use of a paper based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for
in  any  applicable  law,  including  the  Federal  Electronic  Signatures  in  Global  and  National  Commerce  Act,  the  New
York  State  Electronic  Signatures  and  Records  Act,  or  any  other  similar  state  laws  based  on  the  Uniform  Electronic
Transactions Act.

SECTION 9          Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS REFINANCING AMENDMENT AND
ANY  CLAIM,  CONTROVERSY,  DISPUTE  OR  CAUSE  OF  ACTION  (WHETHER  IN  CONTRACT  OR  TORT  OR  OTHERWISE)

CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The provisions of Sections 10.11 and
10.15 of the Credit Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference herein, mutatis mutandis.

SECTION 10        Headings. Section headings herein are included herein for convenience of reference only

and shall not constitute a part hereof for any other purpose or be given any substantive eﬀect.

SECTION  11         No  Novation;  Eﬀect  of  this  Reﬁnancing  Amendment.  This  Reﬁnancing  Amendment
does  not  extinguish  the  Obligations  for  the  payment  of  money  outstanding  under  the  Credit  Agreement  or
discharge  or  release  the  lien  or  priority  of  any  Loan  Document  or  any  other  security  therefor  or  any  guarantee
thereof,  and,  subject  to  Section  6  of  this  Reﬁnancing  Amendment,  the  liens  and  security  interests  existing
immediately  prior  to  the  Fourth  Amendment  Eﬀective  Date  in  favor  of  the  Collateral  Agent  for  the  beneﬁt  of  the
Secured Parties securing payment of the Obligations are in all respects continuing and in full force and eﬀect with
respect  to  all  Obligations.  Except  as  expressly  provided,  nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  construed  as  a
substitution or novation, or a payment and reborrowing, or a termination, of the Obligations outstanding under the
Credit  Agreement  or  instruments  guaranteeing  or  securing  the  same,  which  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  eﬀect,
except as modiﬁed hereby or by instruments executed concurrently herewith. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Reﬁnancing  Amendment  or  any  other  document  contemplated  hereby  shall  be  construed  as  a  release  or  other
discharge of Holdings or the Borrower under the Credit Agreement or the Borrower or any other Loan Party under
any  Loan  Document  from  any  of  its  obligations  and  liabilities  thereunder,  and  except  as  expressly  provided,  such
obligations  are  in  all  respects  continuing  with  only  the  terms  being  modiﬁed  as  provided  in  this  Reﬁnancing
Amendment. The Credit Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and eﬀect, until
and except as modiﬁed. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Reﬁnancing Amendment shall not by implication
or otherwise limit, impair, constitute a waiver of, or otherwise aﬀect the rights and remedies of the Lenders or the
Agents under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, and shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way
aﬀect any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any
other Loan Document, all of which are ratiﬁed and aﬃrmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and eﬀect.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle any Loan Party to a consent to, or a waiver, amendment, modiﬁcation or
other  change  of,  any  of  the  terms,  conditions,  obligations,  covenants  or  agreements  contained  in  the  Credit
Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document  in  similar  or  diﬀerent  circumstances.  This  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  shall
apply  and  be  eﬀective  only  with  respect  to  the  provisions  of  the  Credit  Agreement  speciﬁcally  referred  to  herein.
Each  Subsidiary  Loan  Party  further  agrees  that  nothing  in  the  Credit  Agreement,  this  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  or
any  other  Loan  Document  shall  be  deemed  to  require  the  consent  of  such  Subsidiary  Loan  Party  to  any  future
amendment  to  the  Credit  Agreement.  This  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  constitutes  a  “Loan  Document”  and  a
“Reﬁnancing Amendment” for all purposes of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 12       Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Reﬁnancing
Amendment  or  in  any  other  Loan  Document  should  be  held  invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable  in  any  respect,  the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be
aﬀected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic eﬀect of which comes as close as possible to that of
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

SECTION 13        No Waiver. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Reﬁnancing Amendment shall not by
implication  or  otherwise  limit,  impair,  constitute  a  waiver  of  or  otherwise  aﬀect  the  rights  and  remedies  of  the
Lenders or the Agents under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, and shall not alter, modify, amend
or  in  any  way  aﬀect  any  of  the  terms,  conditions,  obligations,  covenants  or  agreements  contained  in  the  Credit
Agreement or any other provision of the Credit Agreement or of any other Loan Document, all of which are ratiﬁed
and aﬃrmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and eﬀect. Nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle the
Borrower  to  receive  a  consent  to,  or  a  waiver,  amendment,  modiﬁcation  or  other  change  of,  any  of  the  terms,
conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in
similar or diﬀerent circumstances.

SECTION 14       Additional Arrangers. Pursuant to the terms of the Engagement Letter, the Borrower may
appoint additional arrangers and bookrunners for this Reﬁnancing Amendment and the transactions contemplated
hereby with the consent of the Reﬁnancing Amendment Left Lead Arranger (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Borrower has appointed each of Nomura Securities International, Inc., BofA
Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities LLC (in each case, acting alone or through or with aﬃliates selected by it)
to  act  as  a  joint  lead  arranger  and  joint  bookrunner  with  respect  to  this  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  and  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  (and  the  Reﬁnancing  Amendment  Left  Lead  Arranger  hereby  consents  to  such
appointment), in each case, with the rights and privileges aﬀorded to arrangers pursuant to the Engagement Letter.

SECTION 15        Assignments of Term Loans. The Borrower and the Administrative Agent hereby consent
to  each  assignment  of  2023  Other  Term  Loans  made  by  Deutsche  Bank  AG  New  York  Branch  (or  any  Aﬃliate
thereof)  to  any  assignee  (but  only  to  the  extent  the  applicable  assignee  (or  an  Aﬃliate  thereof,  other  than  a
Disqualiﬁed Institution) has been identiﬁed on a list approved by the Borrower on or prior to the Fourth Amendment
Eﬀective Date).

SECTION  16         Limited  Waiver.  The  Borrower  acknowledges  and  agrees  that,  as  of  the  Fourth
Amendment  Eﬀective  Date,  (i)  one  or  more  Defaults  or  Events  of  Default  pursuant  to  Section  8.01  of  the  Credit
Agreement  may  have  occurred  and  may  currently  exist  under  the  Credit  Agreement  as  a  direct  result  of  the
Borrower’s failure to deliver one or more Reinvestment Notices pursuant to Section 2.08(1) of the Credit Agreement
that would have allowed the Borrower and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries to use the Net Cash Proceeds of Asset Sales
related to the disposition of certain Real Estate to restore, rebuild, repair, construct, improve, replace or otherwise
acquire assets used or useful in the Borrower’s or a Restricted Subsidiary’s business (any such Default and/or Event
of  Default  described  in  this  clause  (i),  the  “Default  Resulting  from  Failure  to  Deliver  Reinvestment  Notices”),  (ii)  a
Default  or  Event  of  Default  pursuant  to  Section  8.01(4)  of  the  Credit  Agreement  may  have  occurred  and  may
currently  exist  under  the  Credit  Agreement  as  the  result  of  the  Borrower’s  failure  to  deliver  a  notice  of  the
occurrence or existence of any Default from Failure to Deliver Reinvestment Notices, any Representation Default or
any  Default  or  Event  of  Default  resulting  from  the  failure  to  deliver  a  notice  of  the  occurrence  or  existence  of  a
Default  or  Event  of  Default  resulting  from  the  failure  to  deliver  a  notice  of  the  occurrence  or  existence  of  any
Default from Failure to Deliver Reinvestment Notices or any Representation Default (and, in each case, the nature
and extent thereof and any corrective action proposed to be taken or actually taken with respect thereto) pursuant
to  Section  5.05(1)  of  the  Credit  Agreement  (any  Default  and/or  Event  of  Default  described  in  this  clause  (ii),  the
“Notice Default”), and (iii) a Default or Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.01(1) of the Credit Agreement may
have  occurred  and  may  currently  exist  under  the  Credit  Agreement  as  a  result  of  any  misrepresentation  made  or
deemed  to  be  made  by  the  Borrower  with  respect  to  the  absence  of  a  Default  or  Event  of  Default,  which
misrepresentation  was  materially  incorrect  or  misleading  solely  due  to  the  occurrence  of  any  Existing  Event  of
Default  (any  Default  and/or  Event  of  Default  described  in  this  clause  (iii),  the  “Representation  Default”  and,
collectively  with  the  Default  Resulting  from  Failure  to  Deliver  Reinvestment  Notices  and  the  Notice  Default,  the
“Existing Events of Default”, and each, an “Existing Event of Default”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein,  the  Required  Lenders  hereby  unconditionally  and  irrevocably  waive  the  Existing  Events  of  Default  (the
“Waiver”).  The  Waiver  is  limited  precisely  as  written  and  relates  solely  to  the  Existing  Events  of  Default,  and
nothing contained in this Reﬁnancing Amendment shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other provision of
the Credit Agreement or for any other time periods (including any time after the Fourth Amendment Eﬀective Date),
any other rights or remedies the Lenders may have under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Documents or
under applicable law, in each case, with respect to any Default or Event of Default (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Existing Events of Default) that may hereafter exist.
