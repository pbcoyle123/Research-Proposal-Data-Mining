Item 1.01             Entry into a Material Deﬁnitive Agreement.

On  October  18,  2023,  Target  Corporation  (“Target”)  entered  into  a  364-Day  Credit  Agreement  (the  “Credit
Agreement”)  with  the  banks  listed  therein  (the  “Banks”),  the  co-documentation  agents  listed  therein,  Bank  of
America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Agent”), Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent, and BofA Securities, Inc.,
Citibank,  N.A.,  J.P.  Morgan  Securities  LLC,  Wells  Fargo  Securities,  LLC,  and  U.S.  Bank  National  Association,  as  joint
lead  arrangers  and  joint  bookrunners.  The  Credit  Agreement  will  expire  on  October  16,  2024  (the  “Termination
Date”).  In  connection  with  the  entry  into  the  Credit  Agreement,  Target  terminated  its  prior  364-Day  Credit
Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2022, which was scheduled to expire on October 24, 2023.

Under the Credit Agreement, the Banks committed to provide loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0
billion,  which  may  be  increased  from  time  to  time  by  up  to  $500  million.  Borrowings  under  the  Credit  Agreement
bear interest at a base rate or term SOFR rate (which includes a SOFR adjustment), in each case plus an applicable
margin, which varies based on the type of loan and Target’s debt ratings. Target may, at its option, elect to convert
all  loans  outstanding  on  the  Termination  Date  into  term  loans  due  and  payable  on  the  ﬁrst  anniversary  of  the
Termination Date.

The  terms  of  the  Credit  Agreement  include  representations  and  warranties,  aﬃrmative  and  negative  covenants,
including a ﬁnancial covenant regarding the leverage ratio of Target and its consolidated subsidiaries, and events of
default that are customary for credit facilities of this nature. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of
an  event  of  default,  the  Agent  may  terminate  the  commitments  of  the  Banks  under  the  Credit  Agreement  and
declare any outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable.

The  foregoing  description  of  the  Credit  Agreement  is  qualiﬁed  in  its  entirety  by  reference  to  the  full  text  of  the
Credit  Agreement,  a  copy  of  which  will  be  ﬁled  as  an  exhibit  to  Target’s  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  for  the
quarter ending October 28, 2023.
