COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION ANNOUNCES CRAIG JELINEK WILL STEP DOWN AS CEO, RON VACHRIS ELECTED

ISSAQUAH,  Wash.,  October  18,  2023  -  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  (“Costco”  or  the  “Company”)  (Nasdaq:  COST)  announced

Executive Oﬃcer, eﬀective January 1, 2024. Craig and Ron have worked hand in hand over the last twenty-one months in Ron's

Company to have an executive of his caliber to succeed me."

Craig will remain with Costco through April 2024, serving in an advisory role and assisting Ron during the transition. Craig will
also continue to serve on the Board of Directors and will stand for reelection at the January 2024 annual meeting.

The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on Costco common stock
of $1.02 per share. The quarterly dividend is payable November 17, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on
November 3, 2023.

Costco currently operates 861 warehouses, including 591 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 33
in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 18 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, ﬁve in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one
