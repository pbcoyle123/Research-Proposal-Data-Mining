Target Corporation Reports Third Quarter Earnings

• The Company's third quarter operating income margin rate of 5.2 percent was 1.3
percentage points higher than last year, driven by a higher gross margin rate.
1

• Third quarter GAAP and Adjusted EPS  of $2.10 was 36 percent higher than a year ago

and above the high end of the Company's guidance range, reﬂecting disciplined inventory
and expense management.

• Through the ﬁrst three quarters of this year, Target has generated more than $5.3 billion

of operating cash ﬂow, compared with approximately $550 million in 2022.
• Third quarter comparable sales declined 4.9 percent, in line with expectations.

◦ Declines in discretionary categories were partially oﬀset by continued growth in

frequency categories, most notably in Beauty.

◦ Same-day services grew more than 8 percent, led by more than 12 percent growth

in Drive-Up.

• Inventory at the end of Q3 was 14 percent lower than last year, reﬂecting a 19 percent

reduction in discretionary category inventory.

• To deliver newness and value for guests this holiday season, Target will oﬀer more than
10,000 new items for the holidays, with thousands of must-have gifts under $25, and
thousands of exclusive-to-Target items across many categories.

MINNEAPOLIS (November 15, 2023) – Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today announced its

third quarter 2023 ﬁnancial results, which reﬂected stronger-than-expected proﬁt performance

on sales consistent with expectations.

The Company reported third quarter GAAP and Adjusted earnings per share  (EPS) of $2.10, up

1

36.3 percent from $1.54 in 2022. The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to

GAAP measures. All earnings per share ﬁgures refer to diluted EPS.

Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information
about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.

Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation, said “In the third quarter, our

team continued to successfully navigate our business through a very challenging external

environment. While third quarter sales were consistent with our expectations, earnings per

share came in far ahead of our forecast. This proﬁt performance beneﬁted from our team’s

commitment to eﬃciency and disciplined inventory management, and I’d like to thank them for

their tireless eﬀorts. Looking ahead, we’re continuing to make investments throughout our

business -- in our assortment, our team and the services we oﬀer -- to provide the newness,

aﬀordability and convenience our guests want during the holiday season and beyond.”

Guidance

For the fourth quarter, the Company expects comparable sales in a wide range around a mid-

single digit decline, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.90 to $2.60.

Operating Results

Comparable sales declined 4.9 percent in the third quarter, reﬂecting a comparable store sales

decline of 4.6 percent and a comparable digital sales decline of 6.0 percent. Total revenue of

$25.4 billion was 4.2 percent lower than last year, reﬂecting a total sales decline of 4.3 percent

and a 0.6 percent decrease in other revenue. Third quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was

28.9 percent higher than last year, driven by a higher gross margin rate.

Target Corporation Reports Third Quarter Earnings — Page 3 of 12

Third quarter operating income margin rate was 5.2 percent in 2023, compared with 3.9 percent

in 2022. Third quarter gross margin rate was 27.4 percent, compared with 24.7 percent in 2022,

reﬂecting lower markdowns and other inventory-related costs, lower freight costs, lower supply

chain and digital fulﬁllment costs, and favorable category mix. These beneﬁts were partially

oﬀset by higher inventory shrink. Third quarter SG&A expense rate was 20.9 percent in 2023,

compared with 19.7 percent in 2022, reﬂecting the de-leveraging impact of lower sales

combined with higher costs, including continued investments in pay and beneﬁts and

inﬂationary pressures throughout our business, partially oﬀset by disciplined cost management.

Interest Expense and Taxes

The Company’s third quarter 2023 net interest expense was $107 million, compared with $125

million last year, reﬂecting an increase in interest income, partially oﬀset by higher debt levels

and the impact of higher ﬂoating interest rates on interest rate swaps.

Third quarter 2023 eﬀective income tax rate was 21.3 percent, in line with the prior year rate of

21.6 percent.

Capital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital

The Company paid dividends of $507 million in the third quarter, compared with $497 million

last year, reﬂecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.

The Company did not repurchase any stock in the third quarter. As of the end of the quarter, the

Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program

approved by Target’s Board of Directors in August 2021.

For the trailing twelve months through third quarter 2023, after-tax return on invested capital

(ROIC) was 13.9 percent, compared with 14.6 percent for the trailing twelve months through

third quarter 2022. The decrease in ROIC reﬂects faster growth in average invested capital

compared with after-tax returns. The tables in this release provide additional information about

the Company’s ROIC calculation.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To  provide  additional  transparency,  we  have  disclosed  non-GAAP  adjusted  diluted  earnings  per  share  (Adjusted
EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-
to-period comparisons of the results of our operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to,
GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may
calculate Adjusted EPS diﬀerently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Fourth quarter and full-year 2023 GAAP EPS may include the impact of certain discrete items, which will be
excluded in calculating Adjusted EPS. In the past, these items have included losses on the early retirement
of  debt  and  certain  other  items  that  are  discretely  managed.  The  Company  is  not  currently  aware  of  any
such discrete items.

Earnings  before  interest  expense  and  income  taxes  (EBIT)  and  earnings  before  interest  expense,  income  taxes,
depreciation  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  are  non-GAAP  ﬁnancial  measures.  We  believe  these  measures  provide
meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of
diﬀerences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and, for EBITDA, capital investment. These measures are
not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings. EBIT and
EBITDA  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a  substitution  for  analysis  of  our  results  as  reported  in
accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate EBIT and EBITDA diﬀerently, limiting the usefulness of the
measures for comparisons with other companies.

We have also disclosed after-tax ROIC, which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of the add-
back of operating lease interest to operating income. We believe this metric is useful in assessing the eﬀectiveness
of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC diﬀerently, limiting the usefulness of the
measure for comparisons with other companies.

Represents the add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if
the  property  under  our  operating  leases  were  owned  or  accounted  for  as  ﬁnance  leases.  Calculated  using
the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense within SG&A. Operating lease
interest  is  added  back  to  Operating  Income  in  the  ROIC  calculation  to  control  for  diﬀerences  in  capital
structure between us and our competitors.
Calculated  using  the  eﬀective  tax  rates,  which  were  20.3  percent  and  21.5  percent  for  the  trailing  twelve
months  ended  October  28,  2023,  and  October  29,  2022,  respectively.  For  the  twelve  months  ended
October 28, 2023, and October 29, 2022, includes tax eﬀect of $1.0 billion related to EBIT, and $22 million
and $19 million, respectively, related to operating lease interest.
Total  short-term  and  long-term  operating  lease  liabilities  included  within  Accrued  and  Other  Current
Liabilities and Noncurrent Operating Lease Liabilities, respectively.
Average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of
the comparable prior period.
