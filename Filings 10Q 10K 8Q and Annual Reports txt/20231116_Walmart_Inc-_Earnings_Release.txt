Guidance

The following guidance reﬂects the Company’s expectations for ﬁscal year 2024 and is provided
on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in
reported GAAP results, such as the changes in fair value of the Company’s equity and other
investments. Growth rates reﬂect an adjusted basis for prior year results. Additionally, the
Company’s guidance assumes a generally stable consumer and continued pressure from its mix
of products and formats globally. The Company’s ﬁscal year guidance is based on the following
previously disclosed FY23 ﬁgures: Net sales: $605.9 billion, adjusted operating income : $24.6
billion, and adjusted EPS : $6.29.

Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for
such stores and clubs, and it is important to review in conjunction with the company’s ﬁnancial results reported in accordance with
GAAP. Walmart's deﬁnition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including
remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an
important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is
volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales diﬀerently, limiting the comparability
of the metric.

Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(Unaudited)

The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release to which
this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measures calculated and presented in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP ﬁnancial information presented in the
press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the
ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP
ﬁnancial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in
conjunction with, the GAAP ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures in the press
release may diﬀer from similar measures used by other companies.

Constant currency
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the
operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the eﬀect of
changes in currency exchange rates as the diﬀerence between current period activity translated using the current period's
currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate
ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.

Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. When
we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate
ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying
performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations.

The table below reﬂects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three and
nine months ended October 31, 2023.

Adjusted operating income

Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges
included in operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a
meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable
period. In addition, adjusted operating income aﬀords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings
performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the
prior year.

When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the
currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand
Walmart’s underlying performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The tables below reﬂect the
calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency for the three and nine months ended

Free cash ﬂow

We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment
made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023,
which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to
timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially oﬀset by payment of the remaining accrued
opioid legal charges. Free cash ﬂow for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of
$0.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating
cash ﬂows described above, partially oﬀset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment
strategy.

Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow, which measures
our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial measure for use in evaluating the
Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated
net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Additionally, Walmart’s deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for
discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other
contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash ﬂow as
a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Although other companies report their free cash ﬂow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash ﬂow. As
a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may diﬀer from the methods used by other
companies to calculate their free cash ﬂow.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow, a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, to net cash provided by operating
activities, which we believe to be the GAAP ﬁnancial measure most directly comparable to free cash ﬂow, as well as information
regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in ﬁnancing activities.

Adjusted EPS

Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the
SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in
accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management
believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance
with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS aﬀords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s
core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the
prior year.

We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the
investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily
focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast
changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the unrealized
and realized gains and losses related to those equity investments.

We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 by adjusting EPS for the following:

unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity and other investments; and

As previously disclosed in our third quarter ended October 31, 2022 press release, we have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three
and nine months ended October 31, 2022 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) unrealized and realized gains and losses on the
company’s equity and other investments; (2) gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil; (3) a discrete tax item; and (4)
opioid legal charges.

 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in eﬀect for relevant jurisdictions. No tax expense was
incurred in connection with the gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil.

The reported eﬀective tax rate was (23.5%) and 32.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the
eﬀective tax rate was 25.9% and 25.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively.

3
 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests.

 Adjusted EPS for the three months ended October 31, 2022 was calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 2,720 million, which includes the dilutive
impact of share-based payment awards.

Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding.
For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, net losses were primarily driven by decreases in the underlying stock price of our investment in JD.com.

Return on investment

We include return on assets ("ROA"), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
as well as return on investment ("ROI") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful
measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how eﬀectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI
can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA
to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our
calculation of ROI.

ROA was 6.5 percent and 3.7 percent for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase
in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to
lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1 percent and 12.8 percent for the
trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating
income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially oﬀset by an
increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment.

We deﬁne ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve
months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our
beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts
payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.

Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure because we calculate ROI using ﬁnancial measures that exclude
and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP ﬁnancial measure. For example, we
exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our
calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI diﬀers from ROA (which is consolidated net
income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain
expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we
believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.
Although ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method
used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Financial presentation to accompany management commentary FY24 Q3

The following guidance reﬂects the Company’s expectations for ﬁscal year 2024 and is provided on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, such as the changes in fair value of the Company’s equity and other investments. Growth rates reﬂect an adjusted basis for prior year results. Additionally, the Company’s guidance assumes a generally stable consumer and continued pressure from its mix of products and formats globally. The Company’s ﬁscal year guidance is based on the following previously disclosed FY23 ﬁgures: Net sales: $605.9 billion, adjusted operating income1: $24.6 billion, adjusted EPS1 $6.29.

Non-GAAP measures – ROI We include return on assets ("ROA"), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as well as return on investment ("ROI") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how eﬀectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 6.5% percent and 3.7% percent for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1% and 12.8% for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially oﬀset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We deﬁne ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and a

directly comparable GAAP ﬁnancial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI diﬀers from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Non-GAAP measures – free cash ﬂow We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially oﬀset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash ﬂow for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of $0.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating cash ﬂows described above, partially oﬀset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for b

company’s free cash ﬂow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash ﬂow.

Non-GAAP measures – constant currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the eﬀect of changes in currency exchange rates as the diﬀerence between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The table below reﬂects the calculation of constant currency for net sales for the Walmart International segment for the trailing ﬁve quarters and operating income for the current quarter.

Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS aﬀords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the trailing ﬁve quarters as well as the prior year comparable periods by adjusting EPS for the relevant adjustments for each period presented.

Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin The calculation of net income (loss) margin and adjusted EBITDA margin, along with a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin to the calculation of net income (loss) margin, is as follows: Three Months Ended Q3 FY24 Q3 FY23 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Walmart $ 453 $ (1,798) Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (190) (31) Provision for income taxes 272 336 Other (gains) and losses 4,750 3,626 Interest, Net 537 500 Operating Income $ 6,202 $ 2,695 + Depreciation and Amortization 2,986 2,755 + Opioid legal charges — 3,325 Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,188 $ 8,775 Net Sales $ 159,439 $ 151,469 Consolidated net income (loss) margin 0.3 % -1.2 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 5.8 % 5.8 % We include net income (loss) and net income (loss) margin, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principle as well as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to provide meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of certain items. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We also exclude other gains and losses, which is primarily comprised of fair value adjustments on our investments which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. From time to time, we will also adjust certain items from operating income, which we believe is meaningful because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by c

structures, debt levels, capital investments and other items which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. We consider net income (loss) to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of adjusted EBITDA. We consider net income (loss) margin to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of adjusted EBITDA margin. Although adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are standard ﬁnancial measures, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled measures. Net income (loss) margin was 0.3% and -1.2% for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net income margin was primarily due to the increase in net income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in Q3 FY23. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.8% for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained relatively ﬂat as the increase in adjusted EBITDA was oﬀset by the increase in net sales.
