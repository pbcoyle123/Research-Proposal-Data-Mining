Additional Highlights:

•

Total  comparable  club  sales  increased  by  0.3%  in  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  the  third
quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Excluding  the  impact  of  gasoline  sales,  comparable  club  sales  remained
approximately ﬂat, with a decrease of 0.1% in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2023 compared to the same period
in  ﬁscal  2022.  Total  comparable  club  sales  decreased  by  1.2%  in  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  2023
compared  to  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Excluding  the  impact  of  gasoline  sales,  comparable  club
sales  increased  by  2.1%  in  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal
2022.

• Gross  proﬁt  increased  to  $902.5  million  in  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023  from  $877.1  million  in  the  third
quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Merchandise  gross  margin  rate,  which  excludes  gasoline  sales  and  membership  fee
income,  increased  by  30  basis  points  over  the  same  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  Gross  proﬁt  increased  to
$2,679.3 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023 from $2,528.3 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal
2022.  Merchandise  gross  margin  rate  increased  by  70  basis  points  in  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  2023.
Merchandise  margins  were  positively  impacted  by  moderated  supply  chain  costs  and  improved  inventory
management for both comparative periods.

•

•

•

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  ("SG&A")  increased  to  $697.1  million  in  the  third  quarter  of
ﬁscal  2023  compared  to  $674.4  million  in  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2022.  SG&A  increased  to  $2,081.4
million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $1,961.6 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal
2022.  The  increase  in  both  comparative  periods  was  primarily  driven  by  increased  labor  and  occupancy
costs  as  a  result  of  new  club  and  gas  station  openings  in  addition  to  other  investments  to  drive  strategic
priorities.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $181.4 million in the third quarter of
ﬁscal 2023 compared to $179.5 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2022. Income from continuing operations
before income taxes increased to $537.4 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $514.0
million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2022.

Income tax expense increased to $50.9 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $48.1 million
in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2022. Income tax expense increased to $159.7 million in the ﬁrst nine months of
ﬁscal 2023 compared to $129.2 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2022. The increases in the income
tax expense for both comparative periods are driven by lower tax beneﬁts from stock-based compensation.
Income tax expense for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023 also increased due to an immaterial adjustment
to certain deferred tax assets related to prior periods.

• Net income increased to $130.5 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $129.9 million in the
third quarter of ﬁscal 2022. Net income decreased to $377.9 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023
compared to $383.4 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2022.

•

•

Adjusted  EBITDA  increased  by  1.0%  to  $274.9  million  in  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023  compared  to
$272.3 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.4% to $800.7 million in the
ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023 compared to $766.8 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2022.

The  Company  repaid  $50.0  million  of  principal  and  amended  its  senior  secured  ﬁrst  lien  term  loan  in  the
third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023,  extending  the  maturity  date  from  February  3,  2027  to  February  3,  2029.  The
interest  rate  was  reduced  from  the  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  (“SOFR”)  plus  275  basis  points  per
annum to SOFR plus 200 basis points per annum.

• Under its existing share repurchase program, the Company repurchased 242,000 shares of common stock,
totaling  $17.1  million,  inclusive  of  associated  costs,  in  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  2023.  In  the  ﬁrst  nine
months of ﬁscal 2023, the Company repurchased 1,161,162 shares of common stock, totaling $77.0 million,
inclusive of associated costs, under such program.

Fiscal 2023 Ending February 3, 2024 Outlook

“As  we  look  ahead  to  the  rest  of  the  year,  we  remain  conﬁdent  in  our  ability  to  maintain  the  momentum  in  our
traﬃc  and  market  share  gains  due  to  our  unrelenting  focus  on  value.  We  also  continue  to  navigate  shifts  in
consumer  behavior  driven  by  the  broader  macroeconomic  environment.  As  a  result,  we  are  reﬁning  our  sales
outlook for the rest of the year,” said Laura Felice, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Oﬃcer, BJ's Wholesale
Club. “We expect our comparable club sales, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, to range from a 2% decrease
to 1% increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter ﬁscal 2023, and to increase by 1.0% to 1.8% year-over-year for
the  full  year  ﬁscal  2023.  Our  outlook  on  ﬁscal  2023  GAAP  and  adjusted  EPS  remains  unchanged  in  the  $3.80  to
$3.92 range.”

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information

This press release includes ﬁnancial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted
net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, free cash ﬂow, net debt and net debt to last
twelve months (“LTM”) adjusted EBITDA.

We  deﬁne  adjusted  net  income  as  net  income  attributable  to  common  stockholders  adjusted  for:  acquisition  and
integration  costs;  home  oﬃce  transition  costs;  impairment  charges;  charges  related  to  debt  payments;  other
adjustments and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments on net income.

We deﬁne adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted
shares outstanding.

We deﬁne adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before interest expense, net, provision for income
taxes  and  depreciation  and  amortization,  adjusted  for  the  impact  of  certain  other  items,  including:  stock-based
compensation  expense;  pre-opening  expenses;  non-cash  rent;  acquisition  and  integration  costs  and  other
adjustments.

We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property and equipment, net
of disposals, plus proceeds from sale leaseback transactions.

We deﬁne net debt as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents.

We deﬁne net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA as net debt at the balance sheet date divided by adjusted EBITDA for
the trailing twelve-month period.

We  present  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share  and  adjusted  EBITDA,  which  are  not
recognized  ﬁnancial  measures  under  GAAP,  because  we  believe  such  measures  assist  investors  and  analysts  in
comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do
not  believe  are  indicative  of  our  core  operating  performance.  In  addition,  adjusted  EBITDA  excludes  pre-opening
expenses, because we do not believe these expenses are indicative of the underlying operating performance of our
clubs.  The  amount  and  timing  of  pre-opening  expenses  are  dependent  on,  among  other  things,  the  size  of  new
clubs opened and the number of new clubs opened during any given period.

Management  believes  that  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share  and  adjusted  EBITDA  are
helpful  in  highlighting  trends  in  our  core  operating  performance  compared  to  other  measures,  which  can  diﬀer
signiﬁcantly  depending  on  long-term  strategic  decisions  regarding  capital  structure,  the  tax  jurisdictions  in  which
companies  operate  and  capital  investments.  We  use  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share
and  adjusted  EBITDA  to  supplement  GAAP  measures  of  performance  in  the  evaluation  of  the  eﬀectiveness  of  our
business  strategies;  to  make  budgeting  decisions;  and  to  compare  our  performance  against  that  of  other  peer
companies  using  similar  measures.  We  also  use  adjusted  EBITDA  in  connection  with  establishing  discretionary
annual incentive compensation.

We present free cash ﬂow, which is not a recognized ﬁnancial measure under GAAP, because we use it to report to
our  Board  of  Directors  and  we  believe  it  assists  investors  and  analysts  in  evaluating  our  liquidity.  Free  cash  ﬂow
should  not  be  considered  as  an  alternative  to  cash  ﬂows  from  operations  as  a  liquidity  measure.  We  present  net
debt and net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA, which are not recognized as ﬁnancial measures under GAAP, because
we use them to report to our Board of Directors and we believe they assist investors and analysts in evaluating our
borrowing  capacity.  Net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA  is  a  key  ﬁnancial  measure  that  is  used  by  management  to
assess the borrowing capacity of the Company.

You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental
analysis. In evaluating adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and net debt
to LTM adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or like
some  of  the  adjustments  in  our  presentation  of  these  metrics.  Our  presentation  of  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted
net  income  per  diluted  share,  adjusted  EBITDA,  free  cash  ﬂow,  net  debt  and  net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA
should not be considered as alternatives to any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP and they should
not  be  construed  as  an  inference  that  the  Company’s  future  results  will  be  unaﬀected  by  unusual  or  non-
recurring  items.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  not  modify  the  presentation  of  adjusted  net  income,
adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA or net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA in the

8

.

future,  and  any  such  modiﬁcation  may  be  material.  In  addition,  adjusted  net  income,  adjusted  net  income  per
diluted  share,  adjusted  EBITDA,  free  cash  ﬂow,  net  debt  and  net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA  may  not  be
comparable  to  similarly  titled  measures  used  by  other  companies  in  our  industry  or  across  diﬀerent  industries.
Additionally, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, free cash ﬂow, net debt
and  net  debt  to  LTM  adjusted  EBITDA  have  limitations  as  analytical  tools,  and  you  should  not  consider  them  in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

The  Company  does  not  provide  a  reconciliation  for  non-GAAP  estimates  on  a  forward-looking  basis,  including  the
information  under  "Fiscal  2023  Ending  February  3,  2024"  above,  where  it  is  unable  to  provide  a  meaningful  or
accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items or there are no meaningful adjustments to be presented in
the  reconciliation  and  the  information  is  not  available  without  unreasonable  eﬀort.  This  is  due  to  the  inherent
diﬃculty of forecasting the timing and/or amount of various items that would impact net income per diluted share,
if any, which is the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP ﬁnancial measure. This includes items that have
not  yet  occurred,  are  out  of  the  Company's  control,  cannot  be  reasonably  predicted  and/or  for  which  there  would
not  be  any  meaningful  adjustment  or  diﬀerence.  For  the  same  reasons,  the  Company  is  unable  to  address  the
probable signiﬁcance of the unavailable information. The information under "Fiscal 2023 Ending February 3, 2024"
above,  including  expectations  that  GAAP  and  adjusted  EPS  reﬂects  management’s  view  of  current  and  future
market  conditions.  To  the  extent  actual  results  diﬀer  from  our  current  expectations,  the  Company’s  results  may
diﬀer materially from the expectations set forth above. Other factors, as referenced elsewhere in this press release,
may also cause the Company’s results to diﬀer materially from the expectations set forth above.
