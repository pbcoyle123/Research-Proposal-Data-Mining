NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Description of Business

BJ’s  Wholesale  Club  Holdings,  Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  is  a  leading  operator  of  membership
warehouse clubs concentrated primarily in the eastern half of the United States. The Company provides a curated
assortment  focused  on  grocery,  general  merchandise,  gasoline  and  other  ancillary  services,  coupon  books,  and
promotions to oﬀer a diﬀerentiated shopping experience that is further enhanced by its omnichannel capabilities.
As of October 28, 2023, the Company operated 238 warehouse clubs and 169 gas stations in 20 states.

2. Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

The accompanying interim ﬁnancial statements of BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. are unaudited and, in the
opinion of management, reﬂect all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the
Company’s ﬁnancial statements in accordance with GAAP. 

The  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  January  28,  2023  is  derived  from  the  audited  consolidated
balance  sheet  as  of  that  date.  The  Company’s  business,  as  is  common  with  the  business  of  retailers  generally,  is
subject  to  seasonal  inﬂuences.  The  Company’s  sales  and  operating  income  have  typically  been  highest  in
the fourth quarter holiday season and lowest in the ﬁrst quarter of each ﬁscal year. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated ﬁnancial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal
year 2022, as ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2023.

(b) Fiscal Year

The Company follows the National Retail Federation’s ﬁscal calendar and reports ﬁnancial information on a 52-
or  53-week  year  ending  on  the  Saturday  closest  to  January  31.  The  thirteen-week  periods  ended  October  28,
2023 and October 29, 2022 are referred to herein as the "third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023" and the "third quarter of
ﬁscal  year  2022,"  respectively.  The  thirty-nine  week  periods  ended  October  28,  2023  and  October  29,  2022  are
referred to herein as the "thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023" and the "thirty-nine weeks ended October 29,
2022," respectively. Operating results for the thirteen-week and thirty-nine week periods ended October 28, 2023
are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the  results  that  may  be  expected  for  the  53-week  ﬁscal  year  ending  February  3,
2024.

(c) Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Policies

The  Company’s  accounting  policies  are  set  forth  in  the  audited  ﬁnancial  statements  included  in  the
Company’s  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  ﬁscal  year  2022.  There  have  been  no  material  changes  to  these
accounting  policies  and  no  accounting  pronouncements  adopted  that  had  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s
ﬁnancial statements.

3. Revenue Recognition

(a) Performance Obligations

The  Company  identiﬁes  each  distinct  performance  obligation  to  transfer  goods  (or  bundle  of  goods)  or
services.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  as  it  satisﬁes  a  performance  obligation  by  transferring  control  of  the
goods or services to the customer.

Net sales

The Company recognizes net sales at clubs and gas stations when the customer takes possession of the goods
and tenders payment. Sales tax is recorded as a liability at the point-of-sale. Revenue is recorded at the point-of-
sale  based  on  the  transaction  price,  net  of  any  applicable  discounts,  sales  tax  and  expected  refunds.  For  e-
commerce  sales,  the  Company  recognizes  sales  when  control  of  the  merchandise  is  transferred  to  the  customer,
which is typically at the time of shipment.

10

The following table summarizes the Company’s point-of-sale transactions at clubs and gas stations, excluding

sales tax, as a percentage of both net sales and total revenues:

The Company’s BJ’s Perks Rewards membership program which was in place in ﬁscal year 2022 and the ﬁrst
month  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  allowed  participating  members  to  earn  2%  cash  back,  up  to  a  maximum  of
$500 per year, on qualiﬁed purchases made at BJ’s. The Company also oﬀered a co-branded credit card program,
the My BJ’s Perks program, which allowed My BJ’s Perks Mastercard credit card holders to earn up to a 10 cent-per-
gallon discount on gasoline, up to 5% cash back on eligible purchases made in BJ’s clubs or online at bjs.com, and
up  to  2%  cash  back  on  purchases  made  with  the  card  outside  of  BJ’s.  Cash  back  was  in  the  form  of  electronic
awards issued in $10 increments that could be used online or in-club and expired six months from the date issued. 

In  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  the  Company  rebranded  the  rewards  program.  The  former  BJ's  Perks
Rewards membership program is now the Club+ program, whereby participating members earn 2% cash back, up
to  a  maximum  of  $500  per  year,  on  qualiﬁed  purchases  made  at  BJs  and  a  5  cent-per-gallon  discount  at  BJ's  gas
locations.  Cash  back  is  in  the  form  of  electronic  awards  issued  to  each  member  once  $10  in  rewards  have  been
earned. The Company's co-branded credit card program is now the BJ's One and BJ's One+ program, which allows
cardholders with the opportunity to earn up to 5% cash back on purchases made in BJ's clubs or online at bjs.com
and up to a 15 cent-per-gallon discount on gasoline when paying with a BJ's One or BJ's One+ Mastercard at our BJ’s
gas  locations.  Cash  back  is  in  the  form  of  electronic  awards  issued  to  each  member  monthly  on  their  credit  card
statement date. Earned rewards under these two programs do not expire.

The Company accounts for these transactions as multiple-element arrangements and allocates the transaction
price  to  separate  performance  obligations  using  their  relative  fair  values.  The  Company  includes  the  fair  value  of
award  dollars  earned  in  deferred  revenue  at  the  time  the  award  dollars  are  earned.  Earned  awards  may  be
redeemed on future purchases made at the Company. The Company recognizes revenue related to earned awards
when  customers  redeem  such  awards  as  part  of  a  purchase  at  one  of  the  Company’s  clubs  or  on  the  Company’s
website or mobile app. The Company recognizes royalty revenue related to the outstanding My BJ's Perks and BJ's
One  and  BJ's  One+  credit  card  programs  based  upon  actual  customer  activities,  such  as  reward  redemptions.
Additionally, the Company deferred revenue for funds received related to marketing and other integration costs in
connection  with  the  new  co-brand  credit  card  program  and  will  recognize  these  into  revenue  as  performance
obligations are satisﬁed.

Membership

The Company charges a membership fee to its customers, which allows customers to shop in the Company’s
clubs, shop on the Company’s website, and purchase gasoline at the Company’s gas stations for the duration of the
membership, which is generally 12 months. In addition, members have access to other ancillary services, coupon
books, and promotions. As the Company has the obligation to provide access to its clubs, website, and gas stations
for  the  duration  of  the  membership  term,  the  Company  recognizes  membership  fees  on  a  straight-line  basis  over
the life of the membership.

Gift Card Programs

The Company sells BJ’s gift cards that allow customers to redeem the cards for future purchases equal to the
amount  of  the  face  value  of  the  gift  card.  Revenue  from  gift  card  sales  is  recognized  upon  redemption  of  the  gift
cards and control of the purchased goods or services is transferred to the customer.

(c) Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations

Performance obligations related to earned award dollars, royalty revenue and membership fees are typically
satisﬁed over a period of twelve months or less. Funds received related to marketing and other integration costs in
connection  with  our  co-brand  credit  card  program  are  recognized  as  performance  obligations  are  satisﬁed.  The
timing and recognition of gift card redemptions varies depending on consumer behavior and spending patterns.

(d) Disaggregation of Revenue

The Company’s club retail operations, which include retail club and other sales procured from our clubs and
distribution  centers,  represent  substantially  all  of  its  consolidated  total  revenues,  and  are  the  Company’s  only
reportable segment. All the

12

Company’s  identiﬁable  assets  are  in  the  United  States.  The  Company  does  not  have  signiﬁcant  sales  outside  the
United States, nor does any customer represent more than 10% of total revenues for any period presented.

On July 28, 2022, the Company entered into the ABL Revolving Facility with an ABL Revolving Commitment of
$1.2  billion  pursuant  to  that  certain  credit  agreement  (the  "Credit  Agreement")  with  Bank  of  America,  N.A.,  as
administrative  agent  and  collateral  agent,  and  the  other  lenders  party  thereto.  The  maturity  date  of  the  ABL
Revolving Facility is July 28, 2027.

Revolving loans under the ABL Revolving Facility are available in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of
the aggregate ABL Revolving Commitment or a borrowing base based on the value of certain inventory, accounts
and credit card receivables, subject to speciﬁed advance rebates and reserves as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Indebtedness under the ABL Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets (other than real estate) of
the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries,  subject  to  customary  exceptions.  As  amended,  interest  on  the  ABL  Revolving
Facility  is  calculated  either  at  the  SOFR  plus  a  range  of  100  to  125  basis  points  or  a  base  rate  plus  0  to  25  basis
points, based on excess availability. The Company will also pay an unused commitment fee of 20 basis points per
annum on the unused ABL Revolving Commitment. Each borrowing is for a period of one, three, or six months, as
selected  by  the  Company,  or  for  such  other  period  that  is  twelve  months  or  less  requested  by  the  Company  and
consented to by the lenders and administrative agent.

The  ABL  Revolving  Facility  places  certain  restrictions  (i.e.,  covenants)  upon  the  Borrower’s,  and  its
subsidiaries’, ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make certain loans,
investments, and divestitures. The ABL Revolving Facility contains customary events of default (including payment
defaults, cross-defaults to certain of the Company's other indebtedness, breach of representations and covenants
and  change  of  control).  The  occurrence  of  an  event  of  default  under  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  would  permit  the
lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the ABL Revolving Facility.

As  of  October  28,  2023,  there  was  $434.0  million  outstanding  in  loans  under  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  and
$12.3 million in outstanding letters of credit. The interest rate on the ABL Revolving Facility was 6.43% and unused
capacity was $753.7 million.

First Lien Term Loan

On  October  12,  2023,  the  Company  entered  into  an  amendment  (the  “Fourth  Amendment”)  to  the  First  Lien
Term Loan Credit Agreement, with Nomura Corporate Funding Americas, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral
agent and the

13

lenders party thereto. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as the left lead arranger and bookrunner, and Nomura
Securities International, Inc., BofA Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities LLC acted as joint lead arrangers and
joint bookrunners of the Fourth Amendment.

The  Fourth  Amendment,  among  other  things,  extends  the  maturity  date  with  respect  to  the  term  loans
outstanding  under  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan  Credit  Agreement  from  February  3,  2027  to  February  3,  2029.  In
addition,  the  Fourth  Amendment  reduces  applicable  margin  in  respect  of  the  interest  rate,  eﬀective  immediately,
from SOFR plus 275 basis points per annum to SOFR plus 200 basis points per annum.

Voluntary prepayments are permitted. Principal payments must be made on the First Lien Term Loan pursuant
to an annual excess cash ﬂow calculation when the net leverage ratio exceeds 3.50 to 1.00. As of October 28, 2023,
the  Company's  net  leverage  ratio  did  not  exceed  3.50  to  1.00,  and  therefore,  no  incremental  principal  payments
were  required.  The  First  Lien  Term  Loan  is  subject  to  certain  aﬃrmative  and  negative  covenants  but  no  ﬁnancial
covenants. It is secured on a senior basis by certain "ﬁxed assets" of the Company and on a junior basis by certain
"liquid" assets of the Company.

Total fees incurred in connection with the reﬁnancing were approximately $1.7 million. The Company expensed
$1.4 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs and original issue discount and expensed $0.4 million of
new third-party fees. The Company deferred $1.3 million of new debt issuance costs.

As  of  October  28,  2023,  there  was  $400.0  million  outstanding  under  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan,  which  reﬂects
the  Company's  repayment  of  $50.0  million  of  the  principal  amount  outstanding  under  the  First  Lien  Term  Credit
Agreement  during  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  prior  to  the  Fourth  Amendment.  There  was  $450.0  million
outstanding on the First Lien Term Loan at January 28, 2023 and $601.9 million outstanding at October 29, 2022.
The  interest  rates  were  7.35%,  7.11%,  and  5.35%  at  October  28,  2023,  January  28,  2023,  and  October  29,  2022,
respectively.

5. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail business. In accordance with
applicable  accounting  guidance,  an  accrual  will  be  established  for  legal  proceedings  if  and  when  those  matters
present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. The Company does not believe the resolution of
any current proceedings will result in a material loss to the condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

6. Stock Incentive Plans

On  June  13,  2018,  the  Company’s  board  of  directors  adopted,  and  its  stockholders  approved,  the  BJ’s
Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. 2018 Incentive Award Plan (the "2018 Plan"). The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of
stock  options,  restricted  stock,  dividend  equivalents,  stock  payments,  restricted  stock  units,  performance  shares,
other  incentive  awards,  stock  appreciation  rights,  and  cash  awards.  Prior  to  the  adoption  of  the  2018  Plan,  the
Company granted stock-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors under the Fourth Amended
and  Restated  2011  Stock  Option  Plan  of  BJ’s  Wholesale  Club,  Inc.  (f/k/a  Beacon  Holding  Inc.),  as  amended
(the  "2011  Plan")  and  the  2012  Director  Stock  Option  Plan  of  BJ’s  Wholesale  Club  Holdings,  Inc.  (f/k/a  Beacon
Holding,  Inc.),  as  amended  (the  "2012  Director  Plan").  No  further  grants  will  be  made  under  the  2011  Plan  or
the 2012 Director Plan.

The  2018  Plan  authorizes  the  issuance  of  13,148,058  shares,  including  985,369  shares  that  were  reserved
but not issued under the 2011 Plan and the 2012 Director Plan. If an award under the 2018 Plan, the 2011 Plan, or
the  2012  Director  Plan  is  forfeited,  expires,  or  is  settled  for  cash,  any  shares  subject  to  such  award  may,  to  the
extent  of  such  forfeiture,  expiration,  or  cash  settlement,  be  used  again  for  new  grants  under  the  2018  Plan.
Additionally, shares tendered or withheld to satisfy grant or exercise price, or tax withholding obligations associated
with an award under the 2018 Plan, the 2011 Plan, or the 2012 Director Plan will be added to the shares authorized
for  grant  under  the  2018  Plan.  The  following  shares  may  not  be  used  again  for  grant  under  the  2018  Plan:
(1) shares subject to a stock appreciation right ("SAR") that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement
of the SAR upon its exercise and (2) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise
of  options  under  the  2018  Plan,  2011  Plan,  or  2012  Director  Plan.  As  of  October  28,  2023,  there
were 4,932,865 shares available for future issuance under the 2018 Plan.

On June 14, 2018, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the ESPP, which
became  eﬀective  July  1,  2018.  The  aggregate  number  of  shares  of  common  stock  that  were  to  be  reserved  for
issuance  under  the  ESPP  was  to  be  equal  to  the  sum  of  (i)  973,014  shares  and  (ii)  an  annual  increase  on
the ﬁrst day of each calendar year beginning in 2019 and ending in 2028 equal to the lesser of (A) 486,507 shares,
(B) 0.5% of the shares outstanding (on an as converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding ﬁscal
year  and  (C)  such  smaller  number  of  shares  as  determined  by  the  Company's  board  of  directors.  The  amount  of
expense recognized related to the ESPP was $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 28,
2023  and  October  29,  2022,  respectively,  and  $1.1  million  and  $0.8  million  for  the  thirty-nine  weeks  ended
October  28,  2023  and  October  29,  2022,  respectively.  As  of  October  28,  2023,  there  were  2,463,889  shares
available for issuance under the ESPP.

7. Treasury Shares and Share Repurchase Program

Treasury Shares Acquired on Restricted Stock and Performance Stock Awards

The  Company  acquired  11,052  shares  to  satisfy  employees’  tax  withholding  obligations  upon  the  vesting  of
restricted  stock  awards  in  the  thirteen  weeks  ended  October  28,  2023,  which  was  recorded  as  $0.8  million  of
treasury  stock.  The  Company  acquired  24,885  shares  to  satisfy  employees'  tax  withholding  obligations  upon  the
vesting  of  restricted  stock  awards  in  the  thirteen  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022,  which  was  recorded  as  $1.9
million of treasury stock.

The Company acquired 370,879 shares to satisfy employees’ tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of
restricted  stock  and  performance  stock  awards  in  the  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  28,  2023,  which  was
recorded  as  $28.1  million  of  treasury  stock.  The  Company  acquired  260,730  shares  to  satisfy  employees'  tax
withholding  obligations  upon  the  vesting  of  restricted  stock  awards  in  the  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,
2022, which was recorded as $17.8 million of treasury stock.

Share Repurchase Program

On November 16, 2021, the Company's board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2021
Repurchase  Program")  that  allows  the  Company  to  repurchase  up  to  $500.0  million  of  its  outstanding  common
stock from time to time as market conditions warrant. The 2021 Repurchase Program expires in January 2025. The
Company initiated the 2021 Repurchase Program to mitigate potentially dilutive eﬀects of stock awards granted by
the Company, in addition to enhancing shareholder value.

The Company repurchased 242,000 shares for $17.1 million and 684,819 shares for $50.1 million during the
thirteen  weeks  ended  October  28,  2023  and  October  29,  2022, 
respectively.  The  Company
repurchased  1,161,162  shares  for  $77.0  million  and  1,608,325  shares  for  $108.7  million  during  the  thirty-nine
weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022,

15

respectively. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method based on the fair market value of the
shares on the dates of repurchase plus any direct costs incurred.

As of October 28, 2023, $241.9 million remained available to purchase under the 2021 Repurchase Program.

8. Income Taxes

The Company projects the estimated annual eﬀective tax rate for ﬁscal year 2023 to be 28.2%, excluding the
tax  eﬀect  of  discrete  events,  such  as  excess  tax  beneﬁts  from  stock-based  compensation,  changes  in  tax
legislation, settlements of tax audits and changes in uncertain tax positions, among others.

The  Company’s  eﬀective  income  tax  rate  from  continuing  operations  was  28.1%  and  26.8%  for  the  thirteen
weeks  ended  October  28,  2023  and  October  29,  2022,  respectively.  For  the  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  28,
2023  and  October  29,  2022,  the  Company's  eﬀective  tax  rate  from  continuing  operations  was  and  29.7%  and
25.1%,  respectively.  The  increase  for  both  comparative  periods  was  primarily  driven  by  lower  tax  beneﬁts  from
stock-based  compensation.  The  increase  for  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  2023  was  also  due  to  an  immaterial
adjustment to certain deferred tax assets related to prior periods.

The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. federal and various state taxing jurisdictions. The Company’s
tax years from 2018 forward remain open and subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various
state taxing authorities.

9. Fair Value Measurements

Certain  assets  and  liabilities  are  required  to  be  carried  at  fair  value  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Fair  value  is
deﬁned as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal  or  most  advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants on the measurement date.

The Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy
requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial
assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classiﬁed and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the
fair value hierarchy, of which the ﬁrst two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 such as quoted market prices
for  markets  that  are  not  active  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  be  corroborated  by  observable
market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are signiﬁcant to the
fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash ﬂow methodologies and
similar techniques that use signiﬁcant unobservable inputs.

Financial Assets and Liabilities

The  fair  value  of  the  Company's  long-term  debt  is  estimated  based  on  current  market  rates  for  our  speciﬁc
debt  instrument.  Judgment  is  required  to  develop  these  estimates.  As  such,  the  estimated  fair  value  of  long-term
debt is classiﬁed within Level 2, as deﬁned under U.S. GAAP.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

The Company measures certain non-ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, at fair value on

a non-recurring basis.

The Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other ﬁnancial instruments, including cash, accounts
receivable,  and  accounts  payable,  approximate  their  fair  values  due  to  the  short-term  maturities  of  these
instruments.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The  following  discussion  and  analysis  is  intended  to  promote  an  understanding  of  the  results  of  operations
and ﬁnancial condition of the Company and is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with,
our  condensed  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  and  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the related notes thereto in our
Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  ﬁscal  year  2022.  The  following  discussion  may  contain  forward-looking
statements that reﬂect our plans, estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could diﬀer materially from those
discussed  in  the  forward-looking  statements.  Factors  that  could  cause  such  diﬀerences  are  discussed  in  the
sections  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  titled  "Forward-Looking  Statements"  and  in  Part  I.  "Item  1A.  Risk
Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022.

We report on the basis of a 52- or 53-week ﬁscal year, which ends on the Saturday closest to the last day of
January. Accordingly, references herein to "ﬁscal year 2023" relate to the 53 weeks ending February 03, 2024, and
references herein to "ﬁscal year 2022" relate to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. The third quarter of ﬁscal
year 2023 ended on October 28, 2023, and the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022 ended on October 29, 2022, and
both include thirteen weeks.

Overview

BJ’s  Wholesale  Club  is  a  leading  operator  of  membership  warehouse  clubs  concentrated  primarily  on  the
eastern half of the United States. We deliver signiﬁcant value to our members, consistently oﬀering 25% or more
savings  on  a  representative  basket  of  manufacturer-branded  groceries  compared  to  traditional  supermarket
competitors. We provide a curated assortment focused on groceries, continuously refreshed general merchandise,
gasoline and other ancillary services, coupon books, and promotions to deliver a diﬀerentiated shopping experience
that is further enhanced by our omnichannel capabilities.

Since  pioneering  the  warehouse  club  model  in  New  England  in  1984,  we  have  grown  our  footprint  to
239  large-format,  high  volume  warehouse  clubs  and  169  gas  stations  spanning  20  states  as  of  the  date  of  this
ﬁling. In our core New England markets, which have high population density and generate a disproportionate part
of U.S. gross domestic product, we operate almost three times the number of clubs compared to the next largest
warehouse  club  competitor.  In  addition  to  shopping  in  our  clubs,  members  are  able  to  shop  when  and  how  they
want  through  our  website,  bjs.com,  and  our  highly  rated  mobile  app,  which  allows  them  to  use  our  buy-online-
pickup-in-club ("BOPIC") service, curbside delivery, same-day home delivery or traditional ship-to-home service, as
well as through the DoorDash and Instacart marketplaces where members receive the same preferential pricing as
in-club shoppers by linking their membership. We also oﬀer Same-Day Select, which oﬀers BJ’s members the ability
to pay a one-time fee for either unlimited or twelve same-day grocery deliveries over a one-year period.

Our leadership team continues to focus on utilizing data to improve member experience, instilling a culture of
cost discipline, adopting a more proactive approach to growing our membership base and building an omnichannel
oﬀering oriented towards making shopping at BJ’s more convenient.

Our  goal  is  to  oﬀer  our  members  signiﬁcant  value  and  a  meaningful  return  in  savings  on  their  annual
membership  fee.  We  have  approximately  7.1  million  members  paying  annual  fees  to  gain  access  to  savings  on
groceries  and  general  merchandise  and  services.  The  annual  membership  fee  for  our  Club  Card  membership  is
generally $55, and the annual membership fee for our Club+ membership, which oﬀers additional value-enhancing
features, is generally $110. We believe that members can save over ten times their $55 Club Card membership fee
versus what they would otherwise pay at traditional supermarket competitors when they spend $2,500 or more per
year  at  BJ’s  on  manufacturer-branded  groceries.  In  addition  to  providing  signiﬁcant  savings  on  a  representative
basket  of  manufacturer-branded  groceries,  we  accept  all  manufacturer  coupons  and  also  carry  our  own  exclusive
brands  that  enable  members  to  save  on  price  without  compromising  on  quality.  Our  two  private  label  brands,
Wellsley Farms® and Berkley Jensen®, represented approximately $3.7 billion in annual sales for ﬁscal year 2022
and represented the largest brands we sell in terms of volume. Our customers recognize the relevance of our value
proposition  across  economic  environments,  as  demonstrated  by  over  25  consecutive  years  of  membership  fee
income growth. Our membership fee income was $414.1 million for the trailing twelve-months ended October 28,
2023.

Our business is moderately seasonal in nature. Historically, our business has realized a slightly higher portion
of net sales, operating income, and cash ﬂows from operations in the second and fourth ﬁscal quarters, attributable
primarily to the impact of the summer and year-end holiday season, respectively. Our quarterly results have been,
and will continue to be, aﬀected by the timing of new club openings and their associated pre-opening expenses. As
a  result  of  these  factors,  our  ﬁnancial  results  for  any  single  quarter  or  for  periods  of  less  than  a  year  are  not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full ﬁscal year.

19

Factors Aﬀecting Our Business

Overall economic trends

The overall economic environment and related changes in consumer behavior have a signiﬁcant impact on our
business.  In  general,  positive  conditions  in  the  broader  economy  promote  customer  spending  in  our  clubs,  while
economic  weakness,  which  generally  results  in  a  reduction  of  customer  spending,  may  have  a  diﬀerent  or  more
extreme eﬀect on spending at our clubs. Macroeconomic factors that can aﬀect customer spending patterns, and
thereby  our  results  of  operations,  include  employment  rates,  changes  to  the  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance
Program  (SNAP),  government  stimulus  programs,  tax  legislation,  business  conditions,  changes  in  the  housing
market,  the  availability  of  credit,  interest  rates,  tax  rates  and  fuel  and  energy  costs.  In  addition,  unemployment
rates and beneﬁts may cause us to experience higher labor costs.

Size and loyalty of membership base

The membership model is a critical element of our business. Members drive our results of operations through
their  membership  fee  income  and  their  purchases.  The  majority  of  members  renew  within  six  months  following
their  renewal  date.  Therefore,  our  renewal  rate  is  a  trailing  calculation  that  captures  renewals  during  the  period
seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We have grown our membership fee income each year for the
past 25 years and the quality of our membership mix is strong as evidenced by our higher tier penetration growth
in  the  ﬁrst  thirty-nine  weeks  of  ﬁscal  year  2023.  Our  membership  renewal  rate,  a  key  indicator  of  membership
engagement, satisfaction and loyalty, was 90% at the end of ﬁscal year 2022.

Eﬀective sourcing and distribution of products and consumer demands

Our  net  sales  and  gross  proﬁt  are  aﬀected  by  our  ability  to  purchase  our  products  in  suﬃcient  quantities  at
competitive  prices.  Further,  our  ability  to  maintain  our  appeal  to  existing  customers  and  attract  new  customers
primarily  depends  on  our  ability  to  originate,  develop  and  oﬀer  a  compelling  product  assortment  responsive  to
customer  preferences.  As  a  result,  our  level  of  net  sales  could  be  adversely  aﬀected  due  to  constraints  in  our
supply  chain,  including  our  inability  to  procure  and  stock  suﬃcient  quantities  of  some  merchandise  in  a  manner
that is able to match market demand from our customers.

Infrastructure investment

Our historical operating results reﬂect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have
made  signiﬁcant  investments  in  our  business  that  we  believe  have  laid  the  foundation  for  continued  proﬁtable
growth. We believe that expanding our club footprint, bringing substantially all of our end-to-end perishable supply
chain  in-house,  enhancing  our  information  systems,  including  our  distribution  center  and  transportation
management systems, and investing in hardware and digitally enabled shopping capabilities for convenience, such
as BOPIC, curbside pickup, and same day home delivery will enable us to replicate our proﬁtable club format and
provide a diﬀerentiated shopping experience. We expect these infrastructure investments to support our successful
operating model across our club operations.

Gasoline prices

The  market  price  of  gasoline  impacts  our  net  sales  and  comparable  club  sales,  and  large  ﬂuctuations  in  the
price of gasoline may produce a short-term impact on our margins. Retail gasoline prices are driven by daily crude
oil  and  wholesale  commodity  market  changes  and  are  volatile,  as  they  are  inﬂuenced  by  factors  that  include
changes in demand and supply of oil and reﬁned products, global geopolitical events, regional market conditions,
and supply interruptions caused by severe weather conditions. Typically, the change in crude oil prices impacts the
purchase  price  of  wholesale  petroleum  fuel  products,  which  in  turn  impacts  retail  gasoline  prices  at  the  pump.
During  times  when  prices  are  particularly  volatile,  diﬀerences  in  pricing  and  procurement  strategies  between  the
Company  and  its  competitors  may  lead  to  temporary  margin  contraction  or  expansion,  depending  on  whether
prices are rising or falling, and this impact could aﬀect our overall results for a ﬁscal quarter.

In addition, the relative level of gasoline prices from period to period may lead to diﬀerences in our net sales
between  those  periods.  Further,  because  we  generally  attempt  to  maintain  a  fairly  stable  gross  proﬁt  per  gallon,
this  variance  in  net  sales,  which  may  be  substantial,  may  or  may  not  have  a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  our  operating
income.

Inﬂation and deﬂation trends

20

Our ﬁnancial results can be directly impacted by substantial changes in product costs due to commodity cost
ﬂuctuations  or  general  inﬂation,  disinﬂation  or  deﬂation,  which  could  lead  to  a  reduction  in  our  sales,  as  well  as
greater  margin  pressure,  as  costs  may  not  be  able  to  be  passed  on  to  consumers.  Changes  in  commodity  prices
and  changes  in  inﬂation  rates  have  impacted  several  categories  of  our  business.  Inﬂationary  volatility  can  be
attributed to macro economic factors including supply chain disruptions, government stimulus, interest rates, and
other  factors.  In  response  to  general  inﬂationary  volatility,  we  seek  to  minimize  the  impact  of  such  events  by
sourcing  our  merchandise  from  diﬀerent  vendors,  changing  our  product  mix  or  increasing  our  pricing  when
necessary.

Net sales for the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 were $4.8 billion, a 2.8% increase from net sales reported for
the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022 of $4.7 billion. The increase was due primarily to growth in traﬃc and market
share, particularly in the grocery division as well as comparable gallons at our gas stations.

Net  sales  for  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  were  $14.3  billion,  a  1.5%  increase  from  net  sales
reported for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022 of $14.1 billion. The increase was due primarily to strength in
the grocery division and an increase of six clubs, partially oﬀset by lower gasoline sales.

Comparable Club Sales and Merchandise Comparable Club Sales

We believe net sales is an important driver of our proﬁtability, particularly comparable club sales. Comparable
club sales, which is a non-GAAP metric, also known as same-store sales in the retail industry, includes all clubs that
were open for at least 13 months at the beginning of the period and were in operation during the entirety of both
periods being compared, including relocated clubs and expansions. Comparable club sales allow us to evaluate how
our club base is performing by measuring the change in period-over-period net sales in clubs that have been open
for the applicable period.

Various  factors  aﬀect  comparable  club  sales,  including  customer  preferences  and  trends,  product  sourcing,
promotional oﬀerings and pricing, shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend
on  each  visit,  weather  and  holiday  shopping  period  timing  and  length.  Sales  comparisons  can  be  inﬂuenced  by
certain  factors  that  are  beyond  our  control  such  as  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  macro-economic  factors
such as inﬂation. The higher comparable club sales, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing proﬁtability.

Merchandise  comparable  club  sales  represents  comparable  club  sales  from  all  merchandise  other  than  our
gasoline operations for the applicable period. Merchandise comparable club sales remained approximately ﬂat, with
a  decrease  of  0.1%  in  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  compared  to  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2022,
primarily driven by a decrease in sales of general merchandise and services of approximately 10.9%, partially oﬀset
by an increase in sales of groceries of 1.6%.

In  the  grocery  division,  growth  was  led  by  the  breakfast,  nutrition,  candy,  snack,  fresh  produce  and  bakery
categories when compared to the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022, partially oﬀset by a decrease in sales of fresh
meat and seafood categories.

Sales of general merchandise decreased in the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 due to decreased demand for
electronics,  home,  and  seasonal  merchandise  compared  to  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2022,  driven  by  the
unfavorable  impact  of  weather  and  macroeconomic  conditions  with  consumers  generally  spending  less  on  larger
ticket items.

The impact of gasoline sales is a result of an increase in comparable gallons in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2023

as compared to the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022, as retail prices remained approximately ﬂat.

Merchandise comparable club sales increased by 2.1% in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2023 compared
to  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2022  driven  by  an  increase  in  sales  of  groceries  of  approximately  4.5%,
partially oﬀset by a decrease in sales of general merchandise and services of approximately 11.0%.

Sales increased during the ﬁrst nine months as demand for beverages, candy, snacks, packaged goods, dairy,
and  bakery  categories  increased  compared  to  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2022,  partially  oﬀset  by  a
decrease in demand for fresh meat and seafood categories.

General  merchandise  decreased  during  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  due  to  decreased  demand  for  electronics  and

seasonal merchandise compared to the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022.

 
22

The impact of gasoline sales is primarily a result of lower retail prices through the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal

2023 as compared to the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022.

Membership fee income 

We continue to see growth in the size of our membership base and continued quality. Membership fee income
was $106.1 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $99.5 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal
year 2022, a 6.6% increase.

Membership  fee  income  was  $312.3  million  in  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  compared  to  $294.9
million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022, a 5.9% increase. The increase for both comparative periods was
primarily  driven  by  membership  renewals,  new  members,  and  increased  penetration  of  higher-tier  membership
levels, evidencing the strength of our membership quality. 

Cost of sales 

Cost  of  sales  consists  primarily  of  the  direct  cost  of  merchandise  and  gasoline  sold  at  our  clubs,  including
costs  associated  with  operating  our  distribution  centers,  including  payroll,  payroll  beneﬁts,  occupancy  costs,  and
depreciation;  freight  expenses  associated  with  moving  merchandise  from  vendors  to  our  distribution  centers  and
from distribution centers to our clubs; and vendor allowances, rebates, and cash discounts.

Cost of sales was $4.0 billion, or 83.5% of net sales, in the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $3.9
billion,  or  83.4%  of  net  sales,  in  the  third  quarter  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  Merchandise  gross  margin  rate,  which
excludes gasoline sales and membership fee income, increased 30 basis points over the prior year period.

Cost of sales was $11.9 billion, or 83.4% of net sales, in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2023, remaining
ﬂat compared to $11.9 billion, or 84.1% of net sales, in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022. Merchandise gross
margin rate, which excludes gasoline sales and membership fee income, increased 70 basis points compared to the
ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  Merchandise  margins  were  positively  impacted  by  moderated  supply  chain
costs and improved inventory cost management for both comparative periods.

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

SG&A consists of various expenses related to supporting and facilitating the sale of merchandise in our clubs,
including  the  following:  payroll  and  payroll  beneﬁts  for  team  members;  rent,  depreciation,  and  other  occupancy
costs  for  retail  and  corporate  locations;  share-based  compensation,  advertising  expenses;  tender  costs,  including
credit  and  debit  card  fees;  amortization  of  intangible  assets;  and  consulting,  legal,  insurance,  acquisition  and
integration costs, and other professional services expenses.

SG&A includes both ﬁxed and variable components and, therefore, is not directly correlated with net sales. We
expect that our SG&A will increase in future periods due to investments to spur comparable club sales growth and
our  expanding  footprint  as  we  open  new  clubs.  In  addition,  any  future  increases  in  wages,  stock-based  grants  or
modiﬁcations will increase our SG&A.

SG&A increased by 3.4% to $697.1 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 from $674.4 million in the

third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022.

SG&A increased by 6.1% to $2.1 billion in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2023 from $2.0 billion in the ﬁrst
nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  The  increase  in  SG&A  for  both  comparative  periods  was  primarily  driven  by
increased labor and occupancy costs as a result of new club and gas station openings, as well as other continued
investments to drive strategic priorities. Our growth proﬁle this year is weighted toward owned clubs, elevating our
depreciation expense. We remain focused on investing in member engagement, marketing and digital strategies.

Pre-opening expenses

Pre-opening  expenses  include  startup  costs  for  new  clubs  and  costs  for  relocated  clubs.  Expenses  will  vary
based on the number of club openings, geography of the club, whether the club is owned or leased, and timing of
the opening relative to our period end.

23

Pre-opening expenses were $6.0 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $10.7 million in

the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022.

  Pre-opening  expenses  were  $11.5  million  in  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2023  compared  to  $21.5
million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022. Pre-opening expenses decreased due to timing of spend for club
openings year-over-year for both comparative periods.

Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net was $18.0 million in the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $12.5 million in

the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022.

Interest expense, net was $49.0 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $31.2 million
in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022. The increase for both comparative periods was primarily due to rising
interest rates year-over-year as well as an increase in debt extinguishment charges due to entering into the Fourth
Amendment of the First Lien Term Loan.

Provision for income taxes 

The  Company’s  eﬀective  income  tax  rate  from  continuing  operations  was  28.1%  and  26.8%  for  the  third

quarters of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company’s eﬀective income tax rate from continuing operations was 29.7% and 25.1% for the ﬁrst nine
months of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increases in the eﬀective tax rate and income tax expense
for  both  comparative  periods  are  driven  by  lower  tax  beneﬁts  from  stock-based  compensation.  The  eﬀective  tax
rate for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023 was also increased due to an immaterial adjustment to certain deferred
tax assets related to prior periods.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented
in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  addition  to  relevant  GAAP  measures  we  also  provide  non-GAAP  measures,  including
adjusted EBITDA, comparable club sales, free cash ﬂow, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted
share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts by excluding items that we
do  not  believe  are  indicative  of  our  core  operating  performance.  These  measures  are  customary  for  our  industry
and  commonly  used  by  competitors.  These  non-GAAP  ﬁnancial  measures  should  not  be  reviewed  in  isolation  or
considered as an alternative to any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and should not
be  construed  as  an  inference  that  our  future  results  will  be  unaﬀected  by  unusual  or  non-recurring  items.  In
addition, adjusted EBITDA, comparable club sales, free cash ﬂow, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per
diluted share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across
diﬀerent  industries.  See  Results  of  Operations  above  for  our  comparable  club  sales  and  merchandise  comparable
club sales results. Free cash ﬂow is discussed within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted  EBITDA  is  deﬁned  as  income  from  continuing  operations  before  interest  expense,  net,  provision  for
income  taxes  and  depreciation  and  amortization,  adjusted  for  the  impact  of  certain  other  items,  including  stock-
based  compensation  expense;  pre-opening  expenses;  non-cash  rent;  acquisition  and  integration  costs;  and  other
adjustments.

Adjusted Net Income

The adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share metrics are important measures used by
management  to  compare  the  performance  of  core  operating  results  between  periods.  We  deﬁne  adjusted  net
income as net income as reported, adjusted for non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual charges, net of the tax impact
of  such  adjustments.  We  deﬁne  adjusted  net  income  per  diluted  share  as  adjusted  net  income  divided  by  the
weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.

We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and
analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per
diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash ﬂows generated from club operations and borrowings from our ABL
Revolving  Facility.  As  of  October  28,  2023,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  totaled  $33.6  million  and  we  had  $753.7
million of unused capacity under our ABL Revolving Facility. Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months
and beyond are to fund normal recurring operational expenses and anticipated capital expenditures; fund possible
acquisitions; fund share repurchases; and meet debt service and principal repayment obligations. We believe that
our current resources, together with anticipated cash ﬂows from operations and borrowing capacity under our ABL
Revolving Facility, will be suﬃcient to ﬁnance our operations for at least the next twelve months.

In  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2023,  we  repurchased  1,161,162  shares  under  the  2021  Repurchase

Program totaling $77.0 million.

We  do  not  have  any  oﬀ-balance  sheet  arrangements  that  have,  or  are,  in  the  opinion  of  management,
reasonably likely to have, a current or future material eﬀect on our results of operations or ﬁnancial position. We do,
however, enter into letters of credit and purchase obligations in the normal course of our operations.

Summary of Cash Flows

A  summary  of  our  cash  ﬂows  from  operating,  investing  and  ﬁnancing  activities  is  presented  in  the  following

table:

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was  $444.5  million  for  the  ﬁrst  nine  months  of  ﬁscal  year  2023
compared to $612.9 million for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022. The decrease in operating cash ﬂow was
primarily due to unfavorable ﬂuctuations in working capital and a decrease in pre-tax net income. The unfavorable
ﬂuctuations in working capital were primarily due to merchandise inventories and accounts payable, partially oﬀset
by favorable ﬂuctuations due to accounts receivable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

Net Investing Cash Flows 

Cash used in investing activities was $335.6 million for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2023, compared to
$659.7 million for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022. The decrease is primarily due to $376.5 million of cash
outﬂows  in  the  prior  year  related  to  the  Acquisition,  partially  oﬀset  by  an  increase  in  capital  spending  of  $53.6
million as our growth proﬁle this year is weighted toward owned clubs.

Net Financing Cash Flows 

Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2023 was $109.3 million compared
to net cash provided by ﬁnancing activities of $36.1 million for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2022. The $145.3
million net increase in ﬁnancing cash outﬂows was primarily due to a $266.0 million reduction in net proceeds from
our ABL Revolving

26

 
Facility, partially oﬀset by a net decrease of $100.0 million of principal payments on long-term debt and a decrease
of $25.6 million for the acquisition of treasury stock compared to the prior year.

Free Cash Flow

We  present  free  cash  ﬂow  because  we  use  it  to  report  to  our  board  of  directors  and  we  believe  it  assists
investors and analysts in evaluating our liquidity. Free cash ﬂow should not be considered as an alternative to cash
ﬂows from operations as a liquidity measure. We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities
less additions to property and equipment, net of disposals, plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions.

The following is a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash ﬂow for the

Free cash ﬂow decreased to $47.6 million for the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $75.4 million
for the third quarter of ﬁscal year 2022 primarily due to an increase in capital spending. Free cash ﬂow decreased
to $108.9 million for the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal year 2023 compared to $329.6 million for the ﬁrst nine months
of  ﬁscal  year  2022.  The  decrease  is  primarily  the  result  of  lower  cash  ﬂows  from  operating  activities  due  to
unfavorable ﬂuctuations in working capital and an increase capital spending.

Debt and Borrowing Capacity  

Our primary sources of borrowing capacity are the ABL Revolving Facility and the First Lien Term Loan, which

are further discussed in Note 4, "Debt and Credit Arrangements," included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

On  July  28,  2022,  the  Company  entered  into  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  with  an  aggregate  ABL  Revolving
Commitment of $1.2 billion pursuant to that certain credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative
agent  and  collateral  agent,  and  other  lenders  party  thereto.  The  maturity  date  of  the  ABL  Revolving  Facility  is
July 28, 2027.

On  December  20,  2022,  the  Company  repaid  $151.9  million  of  the  principal  amount  outstanding  under  the

First Lien Term Loan.

On  October  12,  2023,  the  Company  amended  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan  to  extend  the  maturity  date  from
February  3,  2027  to  February  3,  2029  and  reduce  applicable  margin  in  respect  of  the  interest  rate,  eﬀective
immediately,  from  SOFR  plus  275  basis  points  per  annum  to  SOFR  plus  200  basis  points  per  annum.  Prior  to  the
amendment, the Company repaid $50.0 million of the principal amount outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan.

At October 28, 2023, there was $434.0 million outstanding in loans under the ABL Revolving Facility and $12.3
million  in  outstanding  letters  of  credit.  The  interest  rate  on  the  revolving  credit  facility  was  6.43%  and  unused
capacity was $753.7 million.

At  October  28,  2023,  the  interest  rate  for  the  First  Lien  Term  Loan  was  7.35%  and  there  was  $400.0

million outstanding.

Material Cash Commitments 

Our material cash commitments consist primarily of debt obligations, interest payments, leases, and purchase
orders for merchandise inventory. These material cash commitments impact our short-term and long-term liquidity
and capital needs. As of October 28, 2023, other than those items related to the ordinary course of operations of
our business such as inventory purchases, new leases and lease amendments, there were no material changes to
our material cash commitments from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

This  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  ﬁnancial  condition  and  results  of  operations  is  based  on  our  condensed
consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements,  which  we  have  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  The  preparation  of  our
ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that aﬀect
the  reported  amount  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  costs  and  expenses,  and  related  disclosures.  There  were  no
material changes in critical accounting policies and estimates during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form  10-Q.  Refer  to  Item  7.,  "Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of
Operations— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022
for a complete list of our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

There  have  been  no  recent  accounting  pronouncements  since  those  disclosed  in  our  Annual  Report  on  Form

10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022 that have had a material impact on our ﬁnancial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We  are  exposed  to  changes  in  market  interest  rates  and  these  changes  in  rates  will  impact  our  net  interest
expense and our cash ﬂow from operations. Substantially all of our borrowings carry variable interest rates. There
have been no material changes in our market risk from the disclosure included in Part II. "Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risk" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Limitations on Eﬀectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and  procedures,  no  matter  how  well  designed  and  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving
the  desired  control  objectives.  In  addition,  the  design  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  must  reﬂect  the  fact
that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the beneﬁts
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, evaluated,
as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q,  the  eﬀectiveness  of  our  disclosure
controls  and  procedures,  as  deﬁned  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act.  Based  on  that
evaluation,  our  Chief  Executive  Oﬃcer  and  Chief  Financial  Oﬃcer  concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures were eﬀective at the reasonable assurance level as of October 28, 2023. 

Changes in Internal Control

There were no changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting identiﬁed in management’s evaluation
pursuant  to  Rules  13a-15  or  15d-15  of  the  Exchange  Act  during  the  most  recently  completed  ﬁscal  quarter  that
materially aﬀected, or are reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION

We are subject to various litigation, claims and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of business. We believe these actions are routine and incidental to the business. While the outcome of these
actions cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any will have a material adverse impact on our
business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

There have been no material changes to the risk factors relating to the Company set forth under the caption

"Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year 2022.

with regard to the number of shares covered by Laura Felice’s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan which was adopted on July
12, 2023 and has a term of 11 months. The Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan provides for the sale of up to 65,727 shares of
common stock pursuant to the terms of the plan.

Non-Qualiﬁed Deferred Compensation Plan

On November 20, 2023, the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company adopted the
BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc. Non-Qualiﬁed Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) to be eﬀective on January 1, 2024.

The  Plan  is  an  unfunded  arrangement  intended  to  be  exempt  from  the  participation,  vesting,  funding  and
ﬁduciary  requirements  set  forth  in  Title  I  of  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974,  as  amended
(“ERISA”)  and  to  comply  with  Section  409A  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”).  The
obligations of the Company under the Plan will be general unsecured obligations of the Company to pay deferred
compensation in the future to eligible participants (as deﬁned below) in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Any
assets  held  in  the  Plan  remain  subject  to  claims  of  the  Company’s  general  creditors  and  no  participant’s  or
beneﬁciary’s  claim  to  Plan  assets  has  any  priority  over  any  general  unsecured  creditor  of  the  Company.  The
Company may establish a trust in respect of its obligations under the Plan. The establishment of such a trust shall
in no way deem the Plan to be “funded” for purposes of ERISA or the Code.

Pursuant  to  the  Plan,  a  select  group  of  management  or  highly  compensated  employees  of  the  Company
("participants"),  including  the  Company's  named  executive  oﬃcers,  will  be  eligible  to  participate  by  making  an
irrevocable election to defer up to ﬁfty percent (50%) of the participant's annual base salary, as well as up to one
hundred percent (100%) of any annual bonus award. A participant will be 100% vested at all times in their elective
deferral account within the Plan.

In addition, the Company may elect, during any single plan year, to provide a discretionary contribution to the
Plan to a select management participant (deﬁned in the Plan as a participant who is senior vice president level or
higher) on such participant's behalf equal to a percentage of such participant’s base salary grossed up for taxes as
determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Select management participants include the Company’s named
executive  oﬃcers.  A  select  management  participant  shall  become  100%  vested  in  their  select  management
employer  contribution  account  upon  the  earlier  of  such  participant’s  death,  disability,  attainment  of  the  age  of
sixty-ﬁve,  a  change  in  control  of  the  Company,  or  third  anniversary  of  such  participant’s  date  of  hire  with  the
Company. The Company may, in its sole discretion, choose to accelerate such vesting based on criteria satisfactory
to the Company.

Further,  the  Company  may  credit  a  participant  with  additional  discretionary  deferred  compensation.  The
amount  and  frequency  of  such  deferred  compensation  shall  be  determined  by  the  Company  in  its  sole  discretion
and will become vested upon successful completion of the conditions, if any, established by the Company.

The  beneﬁts  under  the  Plan  will  be  paid  to  the  participant,  or  in  the  event  of  death,  to  the  participant’s
beneﬁciary, following the earliest of the participant’s separation from service, death, disability, or the speciﬁed time
elected  by  the  participant,  either  in  installments  or  in  a  lump  sum  payment  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the
Plan and provisions established by the Company.

The Company may, at any time, amend the Plan to comply with the Code or other applicable laws, regulation,
or guidance, provided that such amendment will not result in taxation to any participant under the Code and will
not, without the consent of the participant, aﬀect such participant’s rights with respect to deferred compensation
previously vested. The Company may terminate the Plan under circumstances set forth in Section 7.02 of the Plan.

The  foregoing  summary  of  the  Plan  does  not  purport  to  be  complete  and  is  qualiﬁed  in  its  entirety  by

reference to the Plan, a copy of which is ﬁled as Exhibit 10.2 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

WHEREAS, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) requires limits be
set  on  the  maximum  contributions  and  beneﬁts,  which  may  be  made  to  or  paid  from  a  tax-
qualiﬁed retirement plan on behalf of or to a participant in such a plan; and

the  Internal  Revenue  Code  as  well  as  maximum  beneﬁt  limitations  imposed  by  §402(g),  §415

beneﬁts  which  may  be  made  to  the  tax  qualiﬁed  plans  on  behalf  of  the  key  employees  of  the
Employer; and

WHEREAS,  the  Employer  now  desires  to  provide  a  tax  deferred  capital  accumulation
opportunity  to  a  select  group  of  management  or  highly  compensated  employees  through  the

the Employer and provide ﬂexibility to the employee in his or her ﬁnancial planning; and

and  related  Treasury  guidance  and  Regulations,  and  shall  be  operated  and  interpreted  in

5

    
(A)

Insigniﬁcant or Signiﬁcant Service/Presumptions. The Employer will determine
whether  an  Employee  has  terminated  employment  (and  incurred  a  Separation  from  Service)
based  on  the  facts  and  circumstances  as  described  in  Treas.  Reg.  §1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii).  An
Employee  incurs  a  Separation  from  Service  if  the  parties  reasonably  anticipate,  based  on  the
facts and circumstances, the Employee will not perform any additional services after a certain
date  or  that  the  level  of  bona  ﬁde  services  (whether  performed  as  an  Employee  or  as  a
Contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of bona ﬁde
services  performed  (whether  performed  as  an  Employee  or  as  a  Contractor)  over  the
immediately  preceding  36-month  period  (or,  if  less,  the  period  the  employee  has  rendered
service to the Employer) (“average prior service”). An Employee is presumed to have incurred
a  Separation  from  Service  if  the  Employee’s  service  level  decreases  to  20%  or  less  than  the
average  prior  service  and  an  Employee  is  presumed  to  not  have  incurred  a  Separation  from
Service if the Employee’s service level continues at a rate which is 50% or more of the average
prior service. No presumption applies where the Employee’s service level is more than 20% and
less than 50% of the average prior service.

(B)

Eﬀect of Leave. An Employee does not incur a Separation from Service if the
Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona ﬁde leave of absence if such leave does
not  exceed  a  period  of  6  months,  or  if  longer,  the  period  for  which  a  statute  or  contract
provides  the  Employee  with  the  right  to  reemployment  with  the  Employer.  If  a  Participant’s
leave exceeds 6 months but the Participant is not entitled to reemployment under a statute or
contract,  the  Participant  incurs  a  Separation  from  Service  on  the  next  day  following  the
expiration  of  6  months.  A  leave  of  absence  constitutes  a  bona  ﬁde  leave  of  absence  for  this
Section  only  if  there  is  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the  Employee  will  return  to  perform
services  for  the  Employer.  For  purposes  of  determining  average  prior  service  under  Section
1.32 (A), during a paid leave of absence, which is not a Separation from Service, the Employee
is treated as rendering bona ﬁde services at a level that would have been required to earn the
amount paid during the leave. If the leave of absence is unpaid, the leave period is disregarded
in determining average prior service.

(C)

“Employer” for Purposes of Separation Rules. The “Employer” for purposes of
applying  Section  1.32  (determining  Separation  from  Service  under  the  Plan)  means  Employer
as deﬁned under Section 1.21.

(D)

Dual  Capacity.  If  a  Participant  renders  service  to  the  Employer  both  in  the
capacity as an Employee and as a contractor (or changes status from Employee to contractor
or  vice  versa),  the  Participant  must  incur  a  Separation  from  Service  in  both  capacities  to
constitute a Separation from Service. For this purpose, if a Participant renders service both as
an Employee and as a member of the Employer’s board of directors, the director services are
disregarded  in  determining  whether  the  Participant  has  incurred  a  Separation  from  Service  as
to this Plan provided that the plans are not Aggregated Plans.

(E)

Certain  Asset  Sales.  In  accordance  with  and  subject  to  Treas.  Reg.  §1.409A-
1(h)(4), if the Employer sells its assets to an unrelated party purchaser where the Participants
otherwise  would  incur  a  Separation  from  Service  and  where  such  Participants  will  provide
services  to  the  purchaser  after  the  sale  closing,  the  Employer  and  the  purchaser  retain
discretion no later than the asset sale closing date to specify in writing whether the Participants
will  incur  a  Separation  from  Service.  In  making  such  determination,  the  Employer  and  the
purchaser must treat all aﬀected Participants consistently.

1.33 “Service  Year”  means  a  Participant’s  Taxable  Year  in  which  the  Participant

performs services which give rise to Compensation.

6

    
1.34 “Speciﬁed Employee” means a Participant who is a key employee as described in
Code  §416(i),  disregarding  paragraph  (5)  thereof.  However,  a  Participant  is  not  a  Speciﬁed
Employee  unless  any  stock  of  the  Employer  is  publicly  traded  on  an  established  securities
market or otherwise. If a Participant is a key employee at any time during the 12 months ending
on  December  31  (the  “identiﬁcation  date”),  the  Participant  is  a  Speciﬁed  Employee  for  the  12
month  period  commencing  on  the  April  1  following  the  identiﬁcation  date.  The  Employer  in
determining  whether  this  Section  and  all  related  Plan  provisions  apply  will  determine  whether
the  Employer  has  any  publicly  traded  stock  as  of  the  date  of  a  Participant’s  Separation  from
Service. In the case of a spin-oﬀ or merger, or in the case of a nonresident alien Employee, the
Employer will apply the Speciﬁed Employee provisions of the Plan in accordance with Treas. Reg.
§1.409A-1(i)(6) and other Applicable Guidance.

1.35 “Speciﬁed  Time”  means,  in  reference  to  a  payment  of  Deferred  Compensation,
the Employer, at the time of the deferral of the Compensation can objectively determine: (i) the
amount  payable;  and  (ii)  the  payment  date  or  dates.  An  amount  is  objectively  determinable  if
the  deferral  election  speciﬁcally  identiﬁes  the  amount  or  if  the  Employer  can  determine  the
amount at the time it is due pursuant to an objective, nondiscretionary formula speciﬁed at the

such  Deferred  Compensation  shall  be  determined  by  the  Employer  in  its  complete  and  sole
discretion and need not be the same for any two Participants.

Contribution was earned and shall credit the Employer Discretionary Contribution, if any, to the
Participant’s Employer Discretionary Contributions Sub Account no later than the last day of the

ARTICLE IV. - VESTING

        4.01        Elective  Deferral  Sub  Account.  A  Participant’s  Elective  Deferral  Sub-Account  shall
always be 100% Vested and nonforfeitable.

        4.02        Select  Management  Employer  Contribution  Sub  Account.  A  Participant’s  Select
Management Employer Contribution Sub Account shall become 100% Vested and nonforfeitable
upon  the  earlier  of  Participant’s  death,  Disability,  attainment  of  Retirement  Age,  a  Change  in
Control  of  the  Employer,  or  the  third  anniversary  of  the  Participant’s  date  of  hire  with  the
Employer.

        4.03        Employer  Discretionary  Contribution  Sub  Account.  A  Participant’s  Employer

    4.05    Forfeiture. A Participant will forfeit any non-Vested portion of a Participant’s Account
upon the earlier of Separation from Service or when the condition constituting a Substantial Risk
of Forfeiture can no longer be satisﬁed, such as its expiration date. All forfeitures

9

    
shall  be  used  to  reduce  Employer  Contributions  or  shall  be  used  to  pay  reasonable
administrative expenses of the Plan.

ARTICLE V. - BENEFIT PAYMENTS

5.01        Payment  Events.  The  beneﬁts  under  this  Plan  (the  Participant’s  Account)  will  be
paid  to  the  Participant,  or  in  the  event  of  death,  to  the  Participant’s  Beneﬁciary,  following  the
earliest  of  the  Participant’s  Separation  from  Service,  death,  Disability,  or  the  Speciﬁed  Time
elected by the Participant in accordance with this Article V and the provisions established by the
Administrator.  A  Participant  shall  make  a  separate  payment  election  for  each  Taxable  Year  of
deferral. Payment will commence at the time elected and, in the form, elected by the Participant
under Section 5.02 or as provided for under the terms of the Plan under Sections 5.03 through
5.09.

                (A)        Payment  to  Speciﬁed  Employees.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  the
Plan  or  any  Employer  or  Employee  payment  election,  if  the  payment  event  is  Separation  from
Service,  the  Plan  may  not  make  payment  of  any  Account  to  a  Participant  who,  on  the  date  of
Separation  from  Service,  is  a  Speciﬁed  Employee,  earlier  than  6  months  following  Separation
from Service (or if earlier, upon the Speciﬁed Employee’s death), except as permitted under this
Section  5.01(A).  The  Employer,  operationally  and  without  any  direct  or  indirect  Participant
election,  will  elect  whether  any  payments  that  otherwise  would  be  payable  to  the  Speciﬁed
Employee  during  the  foregoing  6  month  period:  (i)  will  be  accumulated  and  payment  delayed
until  the  ﬁrst  day  of  the  month  that  is  after  the  6  month  period;  or  (ii)  will  be  delayed  by  6
months  as  to  each  installment  otherwise  payable  during  the  6  month  period.  This  Section
5.01(A) does not apply to payments made on account of a domestic relations order, payments
made  because  of  a  conﬂict  of  interest,  or  payment  of  employment  taxes,  all  as  described  in
Treas.  Reg.  1.409A-3(i)(2)(i).  Section  5.01(A)  also  does  not  apply  to  any  reimbursement  or  in-
kind  beneﬁt  which  is  Separation  Pay  as  deﬁned  under  Applicable  Guidance,  but  which  is  not
Deferred Compensation under Section 1.15.

5.02    Payment upon Separation from Service.

                (A)          Initial  Payment  Election.  At  the  time  of  initial  enrollment  into  the  Plan,  and  each
Taxable Year thereafter, a Participant shall make an irrevocable election on the form provided by
the  Administrator  no  later  than  the  time  speciﬁed  by  the  Employer  under  Section  3.03.  The
election  shall  specify  the  time  of  payment  in  the  event  of  the  Participant’s  Separation  From
Service, a Speciﬁed Time prior to Separation from Service, death, or Disability. The Participant’s
election  may  provide  for  a  diﬀerent  form  of  payment  for  Separation  from  Service  for  each
Participant’s  Contribution  Sub-Account  for  each  Taxable  Year  of  deferral.  Optional  forms  of
payment permitted are as follows.

                        (1)        Lump  Sum.        The  Participant  may  elect  to  receive  payment  of  his/her  Vested
Taxable Year Contribution Sub-Account in a lump sum payment commencing on the ﬁrst day of
the 7  month following Separation from Service, or

th

        (2)    Installments.    The Participant may elect to receive payment of his/her Vested
Taxable  Year  Contribution  Sub-Account  in  substantially  equal  annual  installments  over  a  period
of time not to exceed ten (10) years.

th
month  following  Separation  from  Service.  The  amount  shall  be  calculated  by  multiplying  the
Participant’s  Vested  Taxable  Year  Contribution  Sub-Account  on  the  Valuation  Date  immediately
preceding the payment date by a fraction of which the numerator is one and the denominator is
the total number of years elected by the Participant.

(a) The  ﬁrst  installment  shall  commence  on  the  ﬁrst  day  of  the  7

10

    
    
    
(b) Following the initial installment payment, subsequent installment
payments shall be made on the anniversary date of the initial installment payment and shall be
calculated  by  multiplying  the  Participant’s  Vested  Taxable  Year  Contribution  Sub-Account
balance on the Valuation Date immediately preceding the payment date by a fraction of which
the  numerator  is  one  and  the  denominator  is  the  whole  number  less  than  the  denominator  of
the fraction used in calculating the immediately preceding annual installment payment until one
hundred percent (100%) of the value has been distributed to the Participant.

(c) Until  the  Plan  pays  the  entire  value  of  the  Participant’s  Vested
Taxable  Year  Contribution  Sub-Account,  the  Plan  will  continue  to  credit  the  Participant’s  Vested
Taxable Year Contribution Sub-Account with Earnings, in accordance with Section 6.03.

(d) Regardless  of  the  period  elected  for  installment  payments,  if  the
value of the ﬁrst annual installment is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the Plan will
pay  the  aﬀected  Participant’s  Vested  Taxable  Year  Contribution  Sub-Account  in  a  single  lump
sum in accordance with Sections 5.02(A)(1) and 5.04 of the Plan, as applicable.

If  a  Participant  dies  after  beneﬁts  have  commenced,  the
remaining unpaid scheduled payments, if any, shall be paid to the Participants Beneﬁciary in a
single lump sum cash payment no later than 90 days following the Participant’s death.

(e)

                (C)        Change  Payment  Election.  The  Participant  may  make  a  change  payment  election
under this Section 5.02(C). A change payment election may delay payment and/or may change
the  form  of  payment,  provided  the  change  does  not  result  in  an  impermissible  acceleration
under Applicable Regulations. A Participant must make any change payment election on a form
the Employer provides for such purpose.

(1)

Election  Timing/Deferral  of  Payment.  Any  change  payment  election:  (i)
may not take eﬀect until twelve (12) months following the date the change payment election is
made;  (ii)  if  the  change  payment  election  relates  to  a  payment  based  on  Separation  from
Service  the  change  payment  election  must  result  in  payment  being  made  not  earlier  than  ﬁve
(5) years following the date upon which the payment otherwise would have been made (or, in
the case of installment payments treated as a single payment, ﬁve (5) years from the date the
ﬁrst amount was scheduled to be paid).

Installments.  For  purposes  of  applying  the  change  payment  election
provisions under Section 5.02(C), the Plan will treat a series of installment payments as a single
payment.

(2)

    5.03    Death, Disability, or Speciﬁed Time. In the event of a Participant’s death, Disability, or
Speciﬁed Time election, a Participant’s Account shall be paid to the Participant, or in the event
of death, to the Participant’s Beneﬁciary, in a single lump sum cash payment no later than (90
days following the event giving rise to the payment.

        5.04        Time,  Form  and  Medium  Default.  If  the  Participant  fails  to  make  a  valid  payment
election  for  any  Taxable  Year,  or  if  the  Employer  rejects  the  Participant’s  election  and  the
Participant  does  not  make  a  new  timely  election  the  Employer  accepts,  the  Plan  will  pay  the
aﬀected  Participant’s  Account  attributable  to  the  non-election  under  this  default  provision  in  a
single lump sum payment in accordance with Sections 5.02(1) and 5.03, as applicable.

5.05    Domestic Relations Order. The Plan may accelerate payment to an individual other
than  the  Participant  to  comply  with  a  domestic  relations  order  as  provided  in  Treas.  Reg.
§1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii).  A  domestic  relations  order  is  a  judgment,  decree,  order,  or  judicial  approval
of a property settlement agreement which relates to child support, alimony, or marital property
rights of a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of the Participant and is made

11

    
            
under state domestic relations law. The Plan will make payment to the alternate payee as soon
as  administratively  feasible  as  speciﬁed  in  the  domestic  relations  order.  In  the  event  the
domestic  relations  order  does  not  specify  a  time  and  form  of  payment,  the  Plan  will  make
payment to the alternate payee in a single lump sum cash payment within 90 days following the
Employer’s acceptance and approval of the domestic relations order.

5.06    No Acceleration.

        (A)    General Rule. No person may accelerate the time or schedule of any Plan payment or
amount  scheduled  to  be  paid  under  the  Plan.  For  this  purpose,  the  payment  of  an  amount
substituted  for  the  Deferred  Compensation  is  a  payment  of  the  Deferred  Compensation,  as
provided in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(f).

        (B)    Not an Acceleration. Certain actions as described in Treas. Reg. §§1.409A-3(j)(1), (2),
(3),  (5)  and  (6)  are  not  an  acceleration  including:  (i)  certain  payments  made  as  a  result  of  an
intervening  payment  event  and  made  in  accordance  with  Plan  provisions  or  pursuant  to  an
initial  payment  election;  (ii)  the  Employer’s  waiver  or  acceleration  of  the  satisfaction  of  any
condition constituting a Substantial Risk of Forfeiture provided that payment is made only upon
a  permissible  payment  event;  (iii)  an  election  to  change  Beneﬁciaries  (including  before  the
commencement  of  a  life  annuity)  if  the  time  and  form  of  payment  does  not  change  (except
where  under  a  life  annuity  a  change  in  time  of  payments  results  solely  from  the  diﬀerent  life
expectancy  of  the  new  Beneﬁciary);  (iv)  a  decrease  in  the  Compensation  Deferred  under  the
Plan as a result of certain linkage to qualiﬁed plans or broad-based foreign plans or certain other
actions  or  inactions,  including  related  to  wraparound  elections;  or  (v)  a  change  to  a  cafeteria
plan  election  (under  Code  §125(d))  resulting  in  a  change  in  the  Compensation  Deferred  under
this Plan.

        (C)     Permissible Accelerations/ Including Cash-Out. Notwithstanding Section 5.06(A), the
Employer  in  its  sole  discretion  and  without  any  Participant  discretion  or  election,  operationally
may  elect  accelerations  of  the  time  or  schedule  of  payment  from  the  Plan  in  any  or  all  of  the
circumstances  described  in  Treas.  Reg.  §§1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii)  through  (xiv).  Such  circumstances
include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  mandatory  lump-sum  payment  of  the  Participant’s  entire
Vested  Account  at  any  time  provided  that  the  Employer  evidences  its  discretion  to  make  such
payment  in  writing  no  later  than  the  date  of  payment,  the  payment  results  in  the  termination
and liquidation of the Participant’s interest under the Plan and under all Aggregated Plans, and
the  payment  amount  does  not  exceed  the  applicable  dollar  amount  under  Code  §402(g)(1)(B).
The Employer in applying this Section 5.06(C) must treat all similarly situated service providers
on a reasonably equivalent basis. See Section 7.02 as to Plan termination which also results in a
permissible acceleration.

5.07        Withholding.  The  Employer  will  withhold  from  any  payment  made  under  the  Plan
and  from  any  amount  taxable  under  Code  §409A,  all  applicable  taxes,  and  any  and  all  other
amounts required to be withheld under Applicable Guidance.

    The beneﬁts that accrue under the Plan are subject to FICA taxes (which includes the
Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance tax and/or Medicare tax, as the case may be) which
may become due before the beneﬁts are actually paid as provided under Section 3121(v)(2) of
the Code and related IRS regulations.

12

    
    
        To  ensure  proper  compliance  with  these  regulations,  the  Employer  will  calculate  the
amount of FICA tax when it becomes due and will deduct the Participant’s share of the FICA tax
on  amounts  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Account  from  other  taxable  compensation  payable  to
the  Participant  by  the  Employer.  If  the  Participant  has  insuﬃcient  other  taxable  compensation
from  the  Employer  from  which  to  deduct  such  tax,  then  the  Employer  will  remit  the  remaining
portion  of  the  Participant’s  share  of  the  tax  to  the  IRS  and  arrange  for  the  collection  of  that
amount  from  the  Participant.  The  Participant  will  be  solely  liable  for  his  or  her  share  of  FICA
taxes on beneﬁts accrued under the Plan.

5.08    Beneﬁciary Designation. A Participant may designate a Beneﬁciary (including one
or  more  primary  and  contingent  Beneﬁciaries)  to  receive  payment  of  any  Vested  Account
remaining in the Participant’s Account at death. The Employer will provide each Participant with
a  form  for  this  purpose  and  no  designation  will  be  eﬀective  unless  made  on  that  form  and
delivered  to  the  Employer.  A  Participant  may  modify  or  revoke  an  existing  designation  of
Beneﬁciary by executing and delivering a new designation to the Employer. In the absence of a
properly designated Beneﬁciary, the Employer will pay a deceased Participant’s Vested Account
to  the  Participant’s  surviving  spouse  and  if  none,  to  the  Participant’s  then  living  lineal
descendants, by right of representation, and if none, to the Participant’s estate. If a Beneﬁciary
is  a  minor  or  otherwise  is  a  person  whom  the  Employer  reasonably  determines  to  be  legally
incompetent, the Employer may cause the Plan or Trust to pay the Participant’s Vested Account
to  a  guardian,  trustee  or  other  proper  legal  representative  of  the  Beneﬁciary.  The  Plan’s  or
Trust’s payment of the deceased Participant’s Vested Account to the Beneﬁciary or proper legal
representative of the Beneﬁciary completely discharges the Employer, the Plan and Trust of all
further obligations under the Plan with respect to that payment.

5.09    Payments Treated as Made on Payment Date.

                (A)        Certain  Late  Payments.  The  Plan’s  payment  of  Deferred  Compensation  is  deemed
made on the Plan required payment date or payment election required payment date even if the
Plan makes payment after such date, provided the payment is made by the latest of: (i) the end
of  the  Taxable  Year  in  which  the  payment  is  due;  (ii)  the  15   day  of  the  third  calendar  month
following the payment due date provided that the Participant is not able, directly or indirectly, to
designate the Taxable Year of payment; (iii) in case the Employer cannot calculate the payment
amount on account of administrative impracticality which is beyond the Participant’s control (or
the control of the Participant’s Beneﬁciary), in the ﬁrst Taxable Year of the Participant in which
payment  is  practicable;  (iv)  in  case  the  making  of  the  payment  on  the  Speciﬁed  Time  would
jeopardize the Employer’s ability to continue as a going concern, in the ﬁrst Taxable Year of the
Participant in which the payment would not have such eﬀect. The Employer may cause the Plan
or Trust to pay a Participant’s Vested Account on any date which satisﬁes this Section and that is
administratively practicable following any Plan speciﬁed payment date or the date speciﬁed in
any valid payment election.

th

        (B)    Disputed Payments. In the event of a dispute between the Employer and a Participant
as to whether Deferred Compensation is payable to the Participant or as to the amount thereof,
or any other failure to pay, payment is treated as paid on the designated payment date if such
payment is made in accordance with Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(g).

        (C)    Early Payments. The Employer also may cause the Plan or trustee to pay on a date no
earlier  than  30  days  before  the  speciﬁed  payment  date  provided  the  Participant  is  not  able,
directly or indirectly, to designate the Taxable Year of the payment. Such “early” payments are
not accelerated payments under Article V.

ARTICLE VI. - TRUST AND PLAN EARNINGS

13

    
        
6.01        Unfunded  Plan/Trust.  Employer  intends  this  Plan  to  be  an  unfunded  plan  that  is
wholly or partially exempt under ERISA. No Participant, Beneﬁciary or successor thereto has any
legal  or  equitable  right,  interest  or  claim  to  any  property  or  assets  of  the  Employer,  including
assets  under  the  Plan  except  as  the  Plan  otherwise  permits.  The  Employer’s  obligation  to  pay
Plan  beneﬁts  is  an  unsecured  promise  to  pay.  Any  assets  held  in  the  Plan  remain  subject  to
claims  of  the  Employer’s  general  creditors  and  no  Participant’s  or  Beneﬁciary’s  claim  to  Plan
assets has any priority over any general unsecured creditor of the Employer.

6.02    Rabbi Trust. Employer may establish a trust in respect of its obligations under this
Plan.  The  Employer  may,  and  at  any  time,  subject  to  the  limitations  of  Section  6.04,  make
deposits of cash or other property in trust for the purpose of providing a source of funds to meet
the liabilities of the Plan. The trustee will pay Plan beneﬁts in accordance with the Plan terms or
upon the Employer’s direction consistent with Plan terms.

6.03        Earnings.  The  Trust  earnings  provisions  apply  to  all  Plan  contributions  and
constitute  Earnings  for  purposes  of  the  Plan.  Each  Participant  will  have  the  right  to  direct  the
investment  of  the  portion  of  the  Trust  that  is  attributable  to  the  Plan’s  obligation  to  that
Participant. The Participant may only select investments designated by the Trustee. Investment
elections  made  or  to  be  made  by  the  Participant  will  be  subject  to  administrative  rules  and
procedures established by the Administrator. If the Participant does not direct the investment of
his  or  her  Account,  the  Participant's  Account  shall  be  treated  as  invested  and  reinvested  in  a
default  investment  category  subject  to  the  administrative  rules  and  procedures  established  by
the  Administrator  until  such  time  as  a  valid  investment  election  is  ﬁled  by  the  Participant.
Earnings shall begin to accrue on any addition from the later of the date the addition is credited
to  the  Participant's  Account,  or  the  date  funds  are  transferred  to  the  related  Trust  for
investment. The Earnings rate to be used during any quarter shall be the actual Earnings during
the period on the funds invested by the Employer on assets set aside for the purpose of paying
beneﬁts  provided  hereunder.  In  the  event  a  Participant  Separates  from  Service  or  otherwise
becomes entitled to a distribution, the Participant's Account shall be credited with Earnings for
any portion of the year up to the Valuation Date used to determine the amount to distribute to
the Participant (or Beneﬁciary). The Valuation Date shall be reasonably close in time to when the
distribution  is  made  in  order  to  minimize  lost  Earnings  to  the  Participant  due  to  being  un-
invested.  However,  the  Plan,  the  Administrator,  and  the  Employer  shall  not  be  under  any
obligation  to  compensate  the  Participant  for  any  potential  earnings  for  the  period  after  the
Valuation Date and before the distribution is received by the Participant.

6.04    Restriction on Trust Assets. The Trust and the Trust assets must be and must remain
located within the United States, except with respect to a Participant who performs outside the
United States substantially all services giving rise to the Deferred Compensation. The Trust may
not  contain  any  provision  limiting  the  Trust  assets  to  the  payment  of  Plan  beneﬁts  upon  a
Change  in  the  Employer’s  Financial  Health,  even  if  the  assets  remain  subject  to  claims  of  the
Employer’s general creditors. For this purpose, the Employer, upon a Change in the Employer’s
Financial Health, may not transfer Deferred Compensation to the Trust. The Employer (and any
member  of  a  controlled  group  which  includes  the  Employer)  during  the  “restricted  period”,  as
deﬁned  in  Code  §409(b)(3)(B),  also  may  not  transfer  Deferred  Compensation  to  the  Trust  and
the Trust may not be restricted to payment of Plan beneﬁts, to the extent that such transfer or
restriction  would  violate  the  at-risk  limitation  of  Code  §409A(b)(3).  Any  Trust  the  Employer
establishes  under  this  Plan  shall  be  further  subject  to  Applicable  Guidance,  compliance  with
which  is  necessary  to  avoid  the  transfer  of  assets  to  the  Trust  being  treated  as  a  transfer  of
property under Code § 83.

6.05    Change in Control. Subject to Section 6.04, in the event of a Change in Control, the
Employer, shall be required to make additional contributions, if any, to the Trust within 10 days
of  the  date  of  the  Change  in  Control  and  annually  thereafter  within  90  days  after  the  end  of
each Plan Year, such that the fair value of the assets in the Trust are suﬃcient to fund the value
of all beneﬁts related to the Accounts of Participants employed by the Employer at the date of

14

    
Change in Control and thereafter at the end of the Plan Year. Any assets set aside in the Trust
shall not be deemed to be the property of the Participant and shall be subject to claims of the
creditors of the Employer. No Participant or Beneﬁciary shall have any claim against, right to, or
security  or  other  interest  in,  any  fund,  account  or  asset  of  the  Employer  from  which  any
payment under the Plan may be made.

ARTICLE VII. - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

7.01    Amendment. Employer reserves the right to amend the Plan at any time to comply
with Code §409A, Treas. Reg. §1.409A and other Applicable Guidance or for any other purpose,
provided  that  such  amendment  will  not  (i)  result  in  taxation  to  any  Participant  under  Code
§409A,  and  (ii)  will  not,  without  the  consent  of  the  Participant,  aﬀect  such  Participant’s  rights
with  respect  to  Deferred  Compensation  previously  Vested  by  him.  Except  as  the  Plan  and
Applicable  Guidance  otherwise  may  require,  the  Employer  may  make  any  such  amendments
eﬀective immediately.

7.02        Termination.  Employer  may  terminate,  but  is  not  required  to  terminate,  the  Plan

and distribute beneﬁts under the following circumstances:

    (A)    Dissolution/Bankruptcy. Employer may terminate and liquidate the Plan within 12
months  following  a  dissolution  of  a  corporate  Employer  taxable  under  Code  §331  or  with
approval of a Bankruptcy court under 11 U.S.C. §503(b)(1)(A), provided that the balance is paid
to the Participants and is included in the Participants’ gross income in the latest Taxable Year: (i)
in  which  the  Plan  termination  and  liquidation  occurs;  (ii)  in  which  the  amounts  no  longer  are
subject  to  a  Substantial  Risk  of  Forfeiture  within  the  meaning  speciﬁed  in  Treas.  Reg.  §1.409A-
1(d)(3) and Applicable Guidance; or (iii) in which the payment is administratively practicable.

    (B)    Change in Control. Employer may terminate and liquidate the Plan by irrevocable
action taken within the thirty (30) days preceding or the twelve (12) months following a Change
in Control provided the Employer distributes all Plan account balances (and must distribute the
accounts under any Aggregated Plans which the Employer also must terminate and liquidate as
to  each  Participant  who  has  experienced  the  Change  in  Control)  within  twelve  (12)  months
following Employer’s irrevocable action to terminate and liquidate the Plan.

        (C)        Other.  Employer  may  terminate  the  Plan  for  any  other  reason  in  Employer’s
discretion  provided  that:  (i)  the  termination  and  liquidation  does  not  occur  proximate  to  a
downturn  in  Employer’s  ﬁnancial  health;  (ii)  Employer  also  terminates  all  Aggregated  Plans  in
which any Participant also is a participant; (iii) the Plan makes no payments in the twelve (12)
months  following  the  date  of  the  Employer’s  irrevocable  action  to  terminate  and  liquidate  the
Plan  other  than  payments  the  Plan  would  have  made  irrespective  of  Plan  termination;  (iv)  the
Plan  makes  all  payments  within  twenty-four  (24)  months  following  the  date  of  Employer’s
irrevocable  action  to  terminate  and  liquidate  the  Plan;  and  (v)  Employer  within  three  (3)  years
following the date of Employer’s irrevocable action to terminate and liquidate the Plan does not
adopt a new plan covering any Participant that would be an Aggregated Plan.

        (D)        Applicable  Guidance.  Employer  may  terminate  the  Plan  under  such  other

circumstances as Applicable Guidance may permit.

7.03    Cessation of Future Awards. Employer may elect at any time to amend the Plan to
cease  future  Elective  Deferrals,  and  or  Employer  Retirement  Contributions,  and  or  Employer
Discretionary  Contributions  under  Article  III  as  of  a  speciﬁed  date.  In  such  event,  the  Plan
remains in eﬀect (except those provisions permitting the frozen award type) until all balances

15

    
are paid in accordance with the Plan terms, or, if earlier, upon the Employer’s termination of the
Plan.

ARTICLE VIII. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

8.01    No Assignment. No Participant or Beneﬁciary has the right to anticipate, alienate,
assign,  pledge,  encumber,  sell,  transfer,  mortgage  or  otherwise  in  any  manner  convey  in
advance  of  actual  receipt,  the  Participant’s  Account.  Prior  to  actual  payment,  a  Participant’s
Account  is  not  subject  to  the  debts,  judgments  or  other  obligations  of  the  Participant  or
Beneﬁciary  and  is  not  subject  to  attachment,  seizure,  garnishment  or  other  process  applicable
to the Participant or Beneﬁciary.

8.02    Not an Employment Contract. This Plan is not a contract for employment between
the Employer and any Employee who is a Participant. This Plan does not entitle any Participant
to  continued  employment  with  the  Employer,  and  beneﬁts  under  the  Plan  are  limited  to
payment of a Participant’s beneﬁt in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

8.03    Fair Construction. The Employer, Participants and Beneﬁciaries intend that this Plan
in  form  and  in  operation  comply  with  Code  409A,  the  regulations  thereunder,  and  all  other
present  and  future  Applicable  Guidance.  The  Employer  and  any  other  party  with  authority  to
interpret  or  administer  the  Plan  will  interpret  the  Plan  terms  in  a  manner  which  is  consistent
with  Applicable  Law.  However,  as  required  under  Treas.  Reg.  §1.409A-1(c)(1), 
the
“interpretation” of the Plan does not permit the deletion of material terms which are expressly
contrary to Code §409A and the regulations thereunder and also does not permit the addition of
missing terms necessary to comply therewith. Such deletions or additions may be accomplished
only  by  means  of  a  Plan  amendment  under  Section  7.01.  Any  Participant,  Beneﬁciary  or
Employer  permitted  Elective  Deferral  election,  initial  payment  election,  change  payment
election or any other Plan permitted election, notice or designation which is not compliant with
Applicable Law is not an “election” or other action under the Plan and has no eﬀect whatsoever.
In  the  event  that  a  Participant,  Beneﬁciary  or  the  Employer  fail  to  make  an  election  or  fail  to
make a compliant election, the Employer will apply the Plan’s default terms under Section 5.04.

8.04    Notice and Elections. Any notice given or election made under the Plan must be in
writing and must be delivered or mailed by certiﬁed mail, to the Employer or to the Participant
or Beneﬁciary as appropriate. Employer will prescribe the form of any Plan notice or election to
be given to or made by Participants. Any notice or election will be deemed given or made as of
the  date  of  delivery,  or  if  given  or  made  by  certiﬁed  mail,  as  of  three  (3)  business  days  after
mailing.

8.05    Administration. Employer will administer and interpret the Plan, including making a
determination of the beneﬁt due any Participant or Beneﬁciary under the Plan. As a condition of
receiving  any  Plan  beneﬁt  to  which  a  Participant  or  Beneﬁciary  otherwise  may  be  entitled,  a
Participant  or  Beneﬁciary  will  provide  such  information  and  will  perform  such  other  acts  as
Employer reasonably may request. Employer may retain agents to assist in the administration of
the Plan and may delegate to agents such duties as it sees ﬁt. The decision of Employer or its
designee  concerning  the  administration  of  the  Plan  is  ﬁnal  and  is  binding  upon  all  persons
having  any  interest  in  the  Plan.  The  Employer  will  indemnify,  defend  and  hold  harmless  the
Board  and  any  Employee  designated  by  the  Board  to  assist  in  the  administration  of  the  Plan
from any and all loss, damage, claims, expense or liability with respect to this Plan (collectively,
“claims”) except claims arising from the intentional acts or gross negligence of the Employee.

8.06        Accounting.  The  Employer  will  maintain  for  each  Participant  as  is  necessary  for
proper  administration  of  the  Plan,  an  Elective  Deferral  Sub  Account,  an  Employer  Retirement
Contribution  Sub  Account,  and  an  Employer  Discretionary  Contributions  Sub  Account,  as
applicable.

16

    
8.07    Account Statements. The Employer from time to time will provide each Participant
with  a  statement  of  the  Participant’s  Account  as  of  the  most  recent  Valuation  Date.  The
Employer also will provide Account statements to any Beneﬁciary of a deceased Participant with
a beneﬁt remaining in the Plan.

8.08        Costs  and  Expenses.  Investment  charges  which  will  be  borne  by  the  Account  to
which  they  pertain.  The  Employer  will  pay  the  other  costs,  expenses  and  fees  associated  with
the  operation  of  the  Plan,  excluding  those  incurred  by  Participants  or  Beneﬁciaries.  The
Employer  will  pay  costs,  expenses  or  fees  charged  by  or  incurred  by  the  trustee  only  as
provided in the Trust or other agreement between the Employer and the trustee.

8.09        Reporting.  The  Employer  will  report  Deferred  Compensation  for  Employee

Participants on Form W-2 in accordance with Applicable Guidance.

8.10        ERISA  Claims  Procedure.  This  Plan  is  established  as  a  “top-hat  plan”  within  the
meaning  of  DOL  Reg.  §2520.104-23,  and  the  following  claims  procedure  under  DOL  Reg.
§2560.503-1  applies.  For  purposes  of  the  Plan’s  claims  procedure  under  this  Section  8.10,  the
“Plan  Administrator”  means  Employer.  A  Participant  or  Beneﬁciary  may  ﬁle  with  the  Plan
Administrator  a  written  claim  for  beneﬁts,  if  the  Participant  or  Beneﬁciary  disputes  the  Plan
Administrator’s determination regarding the Participant’s or Beneﬁciary’s Plan beneﬁt. However,
the Plan Administrator will cause the Plan to pay only such beneﬁts as the Plan Administrator in
its  absolute  discretion  determines  a  Participant  or  Beneﬁciary  is  entitled  to  receive.  The  Plan
Administrator  under  this  Section  8.10  will  provide  a  separate  written  document  to  aﬀected
Participants  and  Beneﬁciaries  which  explains  the  Plan’s  claims  procedure  and  which  by  this
reference  is  incorporated  into  the  Plan.  If  the  Plan  Administrator  makes  a  ﬁnal  written
determination denying a Participant’s or Beneﬁciary’s claim, the Participant or Beneﬁciary must
ﬁle  an  action  with  respect  to  the  denied  claim  within  180  days  following  the  date  of  the  Plan
Administrator’s ﬁnal determination.

8.11    Applicable Law. All questions pertaining to the construction, validity and eﬀect of
the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the United States and to the extent
not preempted by such laws, by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

8.12        Gender  and  Number.  Where  the  context  permits,  words  denoting  the  masculine
gender  shall  include  the  feminine  gender,  the  singular  shall  include  the  plural,  and  the  plural
shall include the singular.

8.13        Statutory  References.  All  references  to  the  Code  and  ERISA  include  reference  to
any  comparable  or  succeeding  provisions  of  any  legislation  which  amends,  supplements  or
replaces such section or subsection.

8.14        Headings.  Section  headings  and  titles  are  for  reference  only.  In  the  event  of  a

conﬂict between a title and the content of a Section, the content of the Section shall control.

8.15        Action  by  the  Employer.  Any  action  to  be  performed  by  Employer  under  the  Plan
shall be by resolution of its Board, by a duly authorized committee of its Board, or by a person
or persons authorized by resolution of such committee.
