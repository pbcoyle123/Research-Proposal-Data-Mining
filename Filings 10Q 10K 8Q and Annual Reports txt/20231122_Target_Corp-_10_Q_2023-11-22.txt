interim  period,  they  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  and  footnotes  required  by  United  States  generally  accepted
accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete ﬁnancial statements. These condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements
should be read in conjunction with the ﬁnancial statement disclosures in our most recent Form 10-K.

We use the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual ﬁnancial statements.

We operate as a single segment that is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through
our digital channels. Nearly all of our revenues are generated in the U.S. The vast majority of our long-lived assets are
located within the U.S.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, quarterly revenues, expenses, earnings, and cash ﬂows are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.

Merchandise sales — We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include
shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Sales are recognized net
of  expected  returns,  which  we  estimate  using  historical  return  patterns  and  our  expectation  of  future  returns.  As  of
October  28,  2023,  January  28,  2023,  and  October  29,  2022,  the  accrual  for  estimated  returns  was  $207  million,  $174

Revenue  from  Target  gift  card  sales  is  recognized  upon  gift  card  redemption,  which  is  typically  within  one  year  of

The carrying amounts of certain other current assets, commercial paper, accounts payable, and certain accrued
and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
The  fair  value  of  debt  is  generally  measured  using  a  discounted  cash  ﬂow  analysis  based  on  current  market
interest  rates  for  the  same  or  similar  types  of  ﬁnancial  instruments  and  would  be  classiﬁed  as  Level  2.  These
amounts exclude commercial paper, fair value hedge adjustments, and lease liabilities.

4. Supplier Finance Programs

We  have  arrangements  with  several  ﬁnancial  institutions  to  act  as  our  paying  agents  to  certain  vendors.  The
arrangements also permit the ﬁnancial institutions to provide vendors with an option, at our vendors' sole discretion, to
sell  their  receivables  from  Target  to  the  ﬁnancial  institutions.  A  vendor’s  election  to  receive  early  payment  at  a
discounted  amount  from  the  ﬁnancial  institutions  does  not  change  the  amount  that  we  must  remit  to  the  ﬁnancial
institutions or our payment date, which is up to 120 days from the invoice date.

We  do  not  pay  any  fees  or  pledge  any  security  to  these  ﬁnancial  institutions  under  these  arrangements.  The
arrangements can be terminated by either party with notice ranging up to 120 days.

Our outstanding vendor obligations eligible for early payment under these arrangements totaled $4.5 billion, $3.4 billion,
and $4.5 billion as of October 28, 2023, January 28, 2023, and October 29, 2022, respectively, and are included within
Accounts  Payable  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Our  outstanding  vendor  obligations  do  not
represent actual receivables sold by our vendors to the ﬁnancial institutions, which may be lower.

5. Property and Equipment

We review long-lived assets for impairment when store performance expectations, events, or changes in circumstances—
such  as  a  decision  to  relocate  or  close  a  store,  oﬃce,  or  distribution  center,  discontinue  a  project,  or  make  signiﬁcant
software changes—indicate that the asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. We recognized impairment charges
of  $64  million  and  $98  million  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  October  28,  2023,  respectively.  We  recognized
impairment  charges  of  $5  million  and  $55  million  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  October  29,  2022,  respectively.
These impairment charges are included in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A).

6. Commercial Paper and Long-Term Debt

We  obtain  short-term  ﬁnancing  from  time  to  time  under  our  commercial  paper  program.  For  the  three  months  ended
October 28, 2023, there were no commercial paper amounts outstanding. For the three months ended October 29, 2022,
the  maximum  amount  outstanding  was  $2.1  billion  and  the  average  daily  amount  outstanding  was  $1.1  billion,  at  a
weighted average annual interest rate of 2.8 percent.

For the nine months ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the maximum amounts outstanding were $90 million
and $2.1 billion, respectively, and the average daily amounts outstanding were $1 million and $713 million, respectively,
at a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.8 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.

No  balances  were  outstanding  as  of  October  28,  2023.  As  of  October  29,  2022,  $2.1  billion  was  outstanding  and  is
classiﬁed  within  Current  Portion  of  Long-Term  Debt  and  Other  Borrowings  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial
Position.

In October 2023, we obtained a new committed $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in
October 2024 and terminated our prior 364-day credit facility. We also exercised our option to extend our existing ﬁve-
year  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility,  which  has  a  maximum  committed  capacity  of  $3.0  billion  and  now  expires  in
October 2028. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2023 or 2022.

7. Derivative Financial Instruments

Our  derivative  instruments  consist  of  interest  rate  swaps  used  to  mitigate  interest  rate  risk.  As  a  result,  we  have
counterparty credit exposure to large global ﬁnancial institutions, which we monitor on an ongoing basis. Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements provides the fair value and classiﬁcation of these instruments.

We  were  party  to  interest  rate  swaps  with  notional  amounts  totaling  $2.45  billion  as  of  October  28,  2023,  January  28,
2023, and October 29, 2022. We pay a ﬂoating rate and receive a ﬁxed rate under each of these agreements. All of the
agreements  are  designated  as  fair  value  hedges,  and  all  were  considered  to  be  perfectly  eﬀective  under  the  shortcut
method during the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022.

During 2023, we amended interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $1.5 billion to replace the London Interbank
Oﬀered Rate (LIBOR) with the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as part of our planned reference rate reform
activities. These amendments did not result in any change to our application of hedge accounting or any impact to our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

We were party to forward-starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $1.45 billion as of October 29, 2022.
During  2022,  we  terminated  all  remaining  forward-starting  interest  rate  swap  agreements.  The  resulting  gains  upon
termination  were  recorded  in  Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Loss  and  will  be  recognized  as  a  reduction  to  Net
Interest Expense over the respective term of the debt.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Table of Contents

Index to Notes

Financial Summary

Third quarter 2023 included the following notable items:

• GAAP and Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.10.
•

Total revenue was $25.4 billion, a decrease of 4.2 percent, reﬂecting a total sales decrease of 4.3 percent and a 0.6
percent decrease in other revenue.
Comparable  sales  decreased  4.9  percent,  reﬂecting  a  4.1  percent  decrease  in  traﬃc  and  a  0.8  percent  decrease  in
average transaction amount.

•

◦ Comparable stores-originated sales declined 4.6 percent.
◦ Comparable digitally-originated sales declined 6.0 percent.

• Operating  income  of  $1.3  billion  was  28.9  percent  higher  than  the  comparable  prior-year  period.  See  Business

Environment below for additional information.

Cash ﬂow provided by operating activities was $5.3 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, compared with
$552 million for the nine months ended October 29, 2022. The drivers of the operating cash ﬂow increase are described
on page 21.

Note:  Adjusted  diluted  earnings  per  share  (Adjusted  EPS),  a  non-GAAP  metric,  excludes  the  impact  of  certain  items.
Management  believes  that  Adjusted  EPS  is  useful  in  providing  period-to-period  comparisons  of  the  results  of  our
operations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 19.

We  report  after-tax  return  on  invested  capital  (ROIC)  because  we  believe  ROIC  provides  a  meaningful  measure  of  our
capital  allocation  eﬀectiveness  over  time.  For  the  trailing  twelve  months  ended  October  28,  2023,  after-tax  ROIC  was
13.9 percent, compared with 14.6 percent for the trailing twelve months ended October 29, 2022. The calculation of ROIC
is provided on page 20.

Business Environment

During  the  third  quarter  of  2023,  we  experienced  sales  declines  across  our  business,  primarily  in  each  of  our
Discretionary categories (Apparel & Accessories, Hardlines, and Home Furnishings & Décor), partially oﬀset by net growth
in  Frequency  categories  (Beauty  &  Household  Essentials  and  Food  &  Beverage).  The  trend  of  decreased  Discretionary
category  sales  began  in  2022.  In  response,  during  2022,  we  took  actions  and  employed  strategies  to  align  inventories
with sales trends. These actions, as well as improvements in the supply chain, have resulted in decreased inventory as of
October 28, 2023 compared with October 29, 2022. These actions and improvements have also resulted in a reduction in
costs related to managing elevated inventory levels and reduced our working capital investment.

Along  with  supply  chain  improvements,  we  have  experienced  a  signiﬁcant  decrease  in  freight  costs  due  to  a  decline  in
freight rates compared to 2022. We have also experienced lower digital fulﬁllment costs due to a decrease in digital sales
and an increased mix of digital sales fulﬁlled through lower-cost same-day services.

We  continue  to  experience  higher  inventory  shrink,  as  a  percentage  of  sales,  relative  to  historical  levels  —  including
signiﬁcantly  higher  shrink  rates  at  certain  stores.  We  believe  that  this  trend  is  pervasive  across  the  retail  industry.
Increased  shrink  has  had,  and  if  current  trends  persist  will  continue  to  have,  an  adverse  impact  on  our  results  of
operations, including impairment of our long-lived assets. Note 5 to the Financial Statements provides more information
on impairment charges, including those related to store closures.

The Gross Margin Rate analysis on page 17 and the Inventory section on page 21 provide additional information.

Note:  Gross  margin  rate  is  calculated  as  gross  margin  (sales  less  cost  of  sales)  divided  by  sales.  All  other  rates  are
calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue.

Sales

Sales include all merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and our estimate of gift card breakage. We use comparable
sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period
over the comparable prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores
open  less  than  13  months,  digital  acquisitions  we  have  owned  less  than  13  months,  stores  that  have  been  closed,  and
digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our
comparable  sales  calculation  is  not  necessarily  comparable  to  similarly  titled  measures  reported  by  other  companies.
Digitally  originated  sales  include  all  sales  initiated  through  mobile  applications  and  our  websites.  Our  stores  fulﬁll  the
majority  of  digitally  originated  sales,  including  shipment  from  stores  to  guests,  store  Order  Pickup  or  Drive  Up,  and
delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulﬁlled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other
third parties.

Sales growth—from both comparable sales and new stores—represents an important driver of our long-term proﬁtability.
We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to
successfully  diﬀerentiate  our  guests’  shopping  experience  through  a  careful  combination  of  merchandise  assortment,
price,  convenience,  guest  experience,  and  other  factors  will,  over  the  long-term,  drive  both  increasing  shopping
frequency (number of transactions, or "traﬃc") and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).

Note 2 to the Financial Statements provides additional product category sales information. The collective interaction of a
broad  array  of  macroeconomic,  competitive,  and  consumer  behavioral  factors,  as  well  as  sales  mix  and  the  transfer  of
sales to new stores, makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.

We  monitor  the  percentage  of  purchases  that  are  paid  for  using  RedCards  (RedCard  Penetration)  because  our  internal
analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on RedCards are also incremental sales for
Target. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a RedCard at Target. For the three
months  ended  October  28,  2023  and  October  29,  2022,  total  RedCard  Penetration  was  18.3  percent  and  19.6  percent,
respectively.  For  the  nine  months  ended  October  28,  2023  and  October  29,  2022,  total  RedCard  Penetration  was  18.6
percent and 20.0 percent, respectively.

Other Performance Factors

Net Interest Expense

For the three months ended October 28, 2023, net interest expense was $107 million compared with $125 million in the
comparable prior-year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income,
partially oﬀset by higher debt levels and the impact of higher ﬂoating interest rates on our interest rate swaps. For the
nine  months  ended  October  28,  2023,  net  interest  expense  was  $395  million  compared  with  $349  million  in  the
respective comparable prior-year period. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average debt
levels in addition to the net impact of higher ﬂoating interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our  eﬀective  income  tax  rate  for  the  three  months  ended  October  28,  2023  was  21.3  percent,  consistent  with  21.6
percent  for  the  comparable  prior-year  period.  Our  eﬀective  tax  rate  for  the  nine  months  ended  October  28,  2023  was
21.5 percent, compared with 19.8 percent in the comparable prior-year period. For the nine month period, the increase
reﬂects higher pretax earnings in the current year, resulting in a smaller tax rate beneﬁt from ongoing and discrete tax
items.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Analysis of Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Capital Allocation

We follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of
importance: ﬁrst, we fully invest in opportunities to proﬁtably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and
maintain  our  current  operations  and  assets;  second,  we  maintain  a  competitive  quarterly  dividend  and  seek  to  grow  it
annually;  and  ﬁnally,  we  return  any  excess  cash  to  shareholders  by  repurchasing  shares  within  the  limits  of  our  credit
rating goals.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.9 billion, $2.2 billion, and $954 million as of October 28, 2023, January 28,
2023,  and  October  29,  2022,  respectively.  Our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  balance  includes  short-term  investments  of
$1.0 billion and $1.3 billion as of October 28, 2023 and January 28, 2023, respectively. We had no short-term investments
as  of  October  29,  2022.  Our  investment  policy  is  designed  to  preserve  principal  and  liquidity  of  our  short-term
investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly-rated direct short-term instruments
that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.

Operating Cash Flows

Cash ﬂows provided by operating activities were $5.3 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, compared with
$552 million for the nine months ended October 29, 2022. For the nine months ended October 28, 2023, operating cash
ﬂows  increased  as  a  result  of  higher  net  earnings  and  an  improvement  in  working  capital,  including  lower  inventory
levels, compared with the nine months ended October 29, 2022.

Inventory

Inventory was $14.7 billion as of October 28, 2023, compared with $13.5 billion and $17.1 billion at January 28, 2023 and
October  29,  2022,  respectively.  The  increase  from  January  28,  2023,  reﬂects  the  seasonal  inventory  build  ahead  of  the
November and December holiday sales period. The decrease from the balance as of October 29, 2022, primarily reﬂects
actions  taken  to  align  inventory  levels  with  sales  trends  and  improvements  in  the  supply  chain,  including  reduced  in-
transit inventory, as well as cost decreases, primarily due to lower freight rates in 2023 compared to 2022.

Cash required for investing activities decreased to $3.9 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, compared to
$4.3 billion for the nine months ended October 29, 2022, due to capital investments.

Dividends

We  paid  dividends  totaling  $507  million  ($1.10  per  share)  and  $1.5  billion  ($3.26  per  share)  for  the  three  and  nine
months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, and $497 million ($1.08 per share) and $1.3 billion ($2.88 per share) for
the three and nine months ended October 29, 2022, respectively, a per share increase of 1.9 percent for the three month
period and 13.2 percent for the nine month period. We declared dividends totaling $513 million ($1.10 per share) during
the third quarter of 2023 and $502 million ($1.08 per share) during the third quarter of 2022, a per share increase of 1.9
percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public oﬀering, and it is our intent to continue to do
so in the future.

Share Repurchase

We did not repurchase any shares during the nine months ended October 28, 2023. See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 8 to the Financial Statements for

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Table of Contents

Index to Notes

Financing

Our  ﬁnancing  strategy  is  to  ensure  liquidity  and  access  to  capital  markets,  to  maintain  a  balanced  spectrum  of  debt
maturities,  and  to  manage  our  net  exposure  to  ﬂoating  interest  rate  volatility.  Within  these  parameters,  we  seek  to
minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us
with  ample  sources  of  liquidity.  Our  continued  access  to  these  markets  depends  on  multiple  factors,  including  the
condition  of  debt  capital  markets,  our  operating  performance,  and  maintaining  strong  credit  ratings.  As  of  October  28,
2023, our credit ratings were as follows:

Credit Ratings
Long-term debt
Commercial paper

Moody’s
A2
P-1

Standard and Poor’s
A
A-1

Fitch
A
F1

If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt
issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no
guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.

We  have  the  ability  to  obtain  short-term  ﬁnancing  from  time  to  time  under  our  commercial  paper  program  and  credit
facilities. In October 2023, we obtained a new committed $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that will
expire  in  October  2024  and  terminated  our  prior  364-day  credit  facility.  We  also  exercised  our  option  to  extend  our
existing ﬁve-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which has a maximum committed capacity of $3.0 billion and now
expires  in  October  2028.  Both  credit  facilities  backstop  our  commercial  paper  program.  No  balances  were  outstanding
under  either  credit  facility  at  any  time  during  2023  or  2022.  We  did  not  have  any  balances  outstanding  under  our
commercial paper program as of October 28, 2023, and we had $2.1 billion outstanding as of October 29, 2022. Note 6 to
the Financial Statements provides additional information.

Most  of  our  long-term  debt  obligations  contain  covenants  related  to  secured  debt  levels.  In  addition  to  a  secured  debt
level covenant, our credit facilities also contain a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance
with  these  covenants.  Additionally,  as  of  October  28,  2023,  no  notes  or  debentures  contained  provisions  requiring
acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to
put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-
term  credit  ratings  are  either  reduced  and  the  resulting  rating  is  non-investment  grade,  or  our  long-term  credit  ratings
are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-
investment grade.

We believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash ﬂows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets,
will  continue  to  be  adequate  to  meet  our  contractual  obligations,  working  capital,  and  planned  capital  expenditures,
ﬁnance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under
our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.

New Accounting Pronouncements

We do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material eﬀect on our ﬁnancial statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This  report  contains  forward-looking  statements,  which  are  based  on  our  current  assumptions  and  expectations.  These
statements are typically accompanied by the words “expect,” “may,” “could,” “believe,” “would,” “might,” “anticipates,”
or  similar  words.  The  principal  forward-looking  statements  in  this  report  include:  our  ﬁnancial  performance,  statements
regarding  the  adequacy  of  and  costs  associated  with  our  sources  of  liquidity,  the  funding  of  debt  maturities,  the
execution  of  our  share  repurchase  program,  our  expected  capital  expenditures  and  new  lease  commitments,  the
expected  compliance  with  debt  covenants,  the  expected  impact  of  new  accounting  pronouncements,  our  intentions
regarding future dividends, the expected return on plan assets, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves
for, claims, litigation, and the resolution of tax matters, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.

All  such  forward-looking  statements  are  intended  to  enjoy  the  protection  of  the  safe  harbor  for  forward-looking
statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a
reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially diﬀerent. The most important
factors which could cause our actual results to diﬀer from our forward-looking statements are set forth in our description
of risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended January 28, 2023, which
should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed
in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended
January 28, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During  the  most  recently  completed  ﬁscal  quarter,  there  were  no  changes  which  materially  aﬀected,  or  are  reasonably
likely to materially aﬀect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the
participation of management, including the chief executive oﬃcer and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, of the eﬀectiveness of the
design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  pursuant  to  Rules  13a-15  and  15d-15  of  the  Securities
Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (Exchange  Act).  Based  upon  that  evaluation,  our  chief  executive  oﬃcer  and  chief
ﬁnancial  oﬃcer  concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  eﬀective  at  a  reasonable  assurance  level.
Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  deﬁned  by  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  of  the  Exchange  Act  as  controls  and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports ﬁled with the SEC
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the SEC’s
rules  and  forms.  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and  procedures  designed  to
ensure  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  us  in  reports  ﬁled  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  accumulated  and
communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  principal  executive  and  principal  ﬁnancial  oﬃcers,  or  persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

from  time  to  time  after  the  Eﬀective  Date  and  prior  to  the  Termination  Date  in  amounts  such
that  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Loans  by  such  Bank  at  any  one  time  outstanding  shall

in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $25,000,000  or  any  larger  multiple  of  $5,000,000  (except
that  any  such  Borrowing  may  be  in  a  lesser  amount  to  the  extent  that  the  aggregate  amount
available in accordance with Section 3.02(b) is less than these requirements) and shall be made
from the several Banks ratably in proportion to their Applicable Percentages; provided, however,
that after giving eﬀect to any such Borrowing of Loans, the Total Outstandings shall not exceed
the  aggregate  Commitments  of  all  Banks  on  the  date  of  such  Borrowing.  Within  the  foregoing
limits, the Borrower may borrow under this Section, repay, or to the extent permitted by Section

Section 2.02    Borrowings; Continuations and Conversions of Loans.

Borrowing,  and  (y)  11:00  A.M.  (New  York  City  time)  on  the  second  Business  Day  before
each  Term  SOFR  Borrowing,  continuation  of  a  Term  SOFR  Borrowing  or  conversion  of  a
Term SOFR Borrowing to a Base Rate Borrowing or conversion of a Base Rate Borrowing to
a Term SOFR Borrowing. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans shall be
in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $25,000,000  or  any  larger  multiple  of  $5,000,000

Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (D) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to

Borrowing,  then  the  requested  Loans  will  be  made  as  Base  Rate  Loans.  If  the  Borrower
fails  to  give  a  timely  notice  requesting  a  conversion  or  continuation  of  any  Term  SOFR
Loans,  then  the  applicable  Loans  shall  be  converted  to,  Term  SOFR  Loans  having  an

having  an  Interest  Period  of  one  (1)  month  shall  be  eﬀective  as  of  the  last  day  of  the
Interest  Period  then  in  eﬀect  with  respect  to  the  applicable  Term  SOFR  Loans.  If  the
Borrower  requests  a  Borrowing  of,  conversion  to,  or  continuation  of  Term  SOFR  Loans  in
any Notice of Borrowing, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it shall be deemed to have
speciﬁed an Interest Period of one (1) month.

(b)    Term SOFR Loans. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may
be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR
Loan.  During  the  existence  of  an  Event  of  Default,  no  Loans  may  be  requested  as,
converted to or continued as Term SOFR Loans without the consent of the Required Banks,
and the Required Banks may demand that any or all of the outstanding Term SOFR Loans
be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans.

(c)    Notice of Interest Rates. The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Banks  of  the  interest  rate  applicable  to  any  Interest  Period  for  Term  SOFR  Loans  upon
determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the
Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks of any change in Bank of America’s “prime
rate”  used  in  determining  the  Base  Rate  promptly  following  the  public  announcement  of
such change.

from  one  Type  to  the  other,  and  all  continuations  of  Loans  as  the  same  Type,  there  shall

(e)        Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Agreement,  any  Bank  may
exchange,  continue  or  rollover  all  of  the  portion  of  its  Loans  in  connection  with  any
reﬁnancing, extension, loan modiﬁcation or similar transaction permitted by the terms of
this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower,
the Agent and such Bank.

(f)        With  respect  to  SOFR  or  Term  SOFR,  the  Agent  will  have  the  right  to  make
Conforming  Changes  from  time  to  time  and,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary
herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming
Changes will become eﬀective without any further action or consent of any other party to
this  Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document;  provided  that,  with  respect  to  any  such
amendment  eﬀected,  the  Agent  shall  post  each  such  amendment  implementing  such
Conforming  Changes  to  the  Borrower  and  the  Banks  reasonably  promptly  after  such

(a)        Upon  receipt  of  a  Notice  of  Borrowing,  the  Agent  shall  promptly  notify  each
Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank’s share (if any) of such Borrowing, and if no
timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Agent shall
notify each Bank of the details of any automatic conversion to Term SOFR Loans having an
Interest Period of one (1) month described in Section 2.02(a).

(b)        Not  later  than  3:00  P.M.  (New  York  City  time)  on  the  date  of  each  Borrowing,
each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section
2.03)  make  available  its  share  of  such  Borrowing,  in  immediately  available  funds,  to  the
Agent  at  its  address  referred  to  in  Section  9.01.  Unless  the  Agent  determines  that  any
applicable condition speciﬁed in Article 3 has not been satisﬁed, the Agent will make the
funds  so  received  from  the  Banks  available  to  the  Borrower  at  the  Agent’s  aforesaid
address.

(c)        Unless  the  Agent  shall  have  received  notice  from  a  Bank  prior  to  the  date  of
any  Borrowing  that  such  Bank  will  not  make  available  to  the  Agent  such  Bank’s  share  of
such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to
the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section
2.03  and  the  Agent  may,  in  reliance  upon  such  assumption,  make  available  to  the
Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall
not  have  so  made  such  share  available  to  the  Agent,  such  Bank  and  the  Borrower
severally  agree  to  repay  to  the  Agent  forthwith  on  demand  such  corresponding  amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the
Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate or the interest
rate  applicable  thereto  pursuant  to  Section  2.06  and  (ii)  in  the  case  of  such  Bank,  the
Federal  Funds  Rate.  If  such  Bank  shall  repay  to  the  Agent  such  corresponding  amount,
such  amount  so  repaid  shall  constitute  such  Bank’s  Loan  included  in  such  Borrowing  for
purposes  of  this  Agreement.  The  failure  of  any  Bank  to  make  available  its  share  of  any
Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its corresponding obligation to do so on the
date  when  due,  and  no  Bank  shall  be  responsible  for  the  failure  of  any  other  Bank  to  so
make its share available.

Section 2.04    Reserved.

thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per
annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for such day plus the Base Rate for such
day. Such interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date. Any overdue

17

principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for
each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate otherwise
applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.

(b)    Each Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof,  for  each  day  during  the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  at  a  rate  per  annum
equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for such day plus Term SOFR for such Interest
Period. Such interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.

(c)    Any overdue principal of or interest on any Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest,
payable on demand, for each day from and including the date payment thereof was due to
but  excluding  the  date  of  actual  payment,  at  a  rate  per  annum  equal  to  the  sum  of  2%
plus  the  higher  of  (i)  the  sum  of  the  Applicable  Margin  for  such  day  plus  Term  SOFR
applicable to such Loan and (ii) the sum of the Applicable Margin for such day plus Term
SOFR as of such day applicable to such Loan amount for a presumed one-month Interest
Period (or if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Business Days, then for a
presumed six-month Interest Period), or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b)
of  Section  8.01  shall  exist,  at  a  rate  per  annum  equal  to  the  sum  of  2%  plus  the  rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.

(d)    The “Applicable Margin” with respect to any Term SOFR Loan or Base Rate
Loan  at  any  date  is  the  applicable  percentage  amount  set  forth  below  in  the  applicable
column, which shall be (i) determined based upon the Debt Rating as speciﬁed below and
(ii) applicable to all Term SOFR Loans and Base Rate Loans existing on and after the ﬁrst
date  a  speciﬁc  Debt  Rating  is  eﬀective  (the  “Debt  Rating  Date”)  and  continuing  until,
but not including, the immediate next Debt Rating Date:

In  the  event  that  the  Debt  Ratings  assigned  by  S&P  and  Moody’s  diﬀer,  the
Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating level having the higher
Debt  Rating  unless  such  ratings  are  more  than  one  level  apart,  in  which  case  the  rating
level  that  is  one  tier  below  the  higher  of  the  two  ratings  shall  determine  the  Applicable
Margin.

The  ﬁnal  Debt  Rating  level  by  which  the  Applicable  Margin  is  determined  is  referred  to
herein as a “Level”.

In the event that either S&P or Moody’s (but not both) shall not make a Debt Rating,
the  above  calculations  of  the  Applicable  Margin  shall  be  made  based  on  (i)  the  rating
provided by S&P or Moody’s, whichever shall then maintain a current Debt Rating, and (ii)
the Debt Rating provided by a nationally recognized securities rating agency selected by
the  Borrower  and  approved  by  the  Agent,  which  shall  be  substituted  for  either  S&P  or
Moody’s,  as  the  case  may  be  (the  “Alternative  Rating  Agency”),  and  the  Alternative
Rating Agency’s equivalent rating levels shall be substituted for the Debt Rating levels of
either S&P or Moody’s, whichever shall no longer then make the applicable Debt Rating.

Section 2.07    Facility Fee; Administrative Fee.

(a)        The  Borrower  shall  pay  to  the  Agent,  for  the  account  of  each  Bank  in
accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a facility fee equal to 0.04% of the Aggregate
Commitments,  subject  to  adjustment  as  provided  in  Section  2.18.  The  facility  fee  shall
accrue at all times while the Aggregate Commitments exist, including at any time during
which  one  or  more  of  the  conditions  in  Section  3.02  is  not  met,  and  shall  be  due  and
payable quarterly in arrears as provided in clause (b) below.

(b)        Accrued  fees  under  this  Section  shall  be  payable  quarterly  in  arrears  on  the
last Business Day of each March, June, September, and December and on the Termination
Date (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety).

        (c)        The  Borrower  shall  pay  to  the  Agent,  for  its  own  account,  the  annual

administrative fee provided for in the Fee Letter.

Section  2.08        Optional  Termination  or  Reduction  of  Commitments.  The  Borrower  may,
upon at least three Business Days’ notice to the Agent, (a) terminate the Commitments at any
time,  if  no  Loans  are  outstanding  at  such  time,  or  (b)  ratably  reduce  from  time  to  time  by  an
aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000, the aggregate amount
of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans.

Section 2.09    Mandatory Termination of Commitments. The Commitments of each Bank
shall terminate on the Termination Date, and any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued
interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

Section 2.10    Optional Prepayments.

(a)    The Borrower may, upon notice to the Agent pursuant to delivery to the Agent
of a Notice of Loan Prepayment, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans
in  whole  or  in  part  without  premium  or  penalty,  subject  to  Section  2.12;  provided  that,
unless otherwise agreed by the Agent, (A) such notice must be received by the Agent not
later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) (1) two (2) Business Days prior to any date of
prepayment of Term SOFR Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans;
and (B) any prepayment of Loans shall be in a principal amount of $25,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, or, if less, the entire principal amount

19

thereof then outstanding. Each such Notice of Loan Prepayment shall specify the date and
amount  of  such  prepayment  and  the  Type(s)  of  Loans  to  be  prepaid  and,  if  Term  SOFR
Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. Any prepayment of principal
of  any  Term  SOFR  Loan  shall  be  accompanied  by  all  accrued  interest  on  the  amount
prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.12. Subject
to  Section  2.18,  each  such  optional  prepayment  shall  be  applied  to  prepay  ratably  the
Loans of the several Banks included in such Borrowing.

(b)        Upon  receipt  of  a  notice  of  prepayment  pursuant  to  this  Section,  the  Agent
shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank’s ratable share
(if  any)  of  such  prepayment  and  such  notice  shall  not  thereafter  be  revocable  by  the
Borrower.

Section 2.11    General Provisions as to Payments.

(a)        The  Borrower  shall  make  each  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on,  the
Loans  and  of  fees  hereunder,  not  later  than  1:00  p.m.  (New  York  City  time)  on  the  date
when  due,  in  immediately  available  funds,  without  set-oﬀ,  deduction,  recoupment  or
counterclaim,  to  the  Agent  at  its  address  referred  to  in  Section  9.01.  The  Agent  will
promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the
Agent for the account of the Banks. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on,
the Base Rate Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date
for  payment  thereof  shall  be  extended  to  the  next  succeeding  Business  Day  unless  such
Business  Day  occurs  after  the  Termination  Date,  in  which  case  the  date  for  payment
thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of,
or interest on, the Term SOFR Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the
date  for  payment  thereof  shall  be  extended  to  the  next  succeeding  Business  Day  unless
such Business Day falls in another calendar month or occurs after the Termination Date, in
which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day.

(b)        With  respect  to  any  payment  that  the  Agent  makes  for  the  account  of  the
Banks  hereunder  as  to  which  the  Agent  determines  (which  determination  shall  be
conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred
to as the “Rescindable Amount”): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment;
(2)  the  Agent  has  made  a  payment  in  excess  of  the  amount  so  paid  by  the  Borrower
(whether  or  not  then  owed);  or  (3)  the  Agent  has  for  any  reason  otherwise  erroneously
made  such  payment;  then  each  of  the  Banks  severally  agrees  to  repay  to  the  Agent
forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Bank, in immediately
available  funds  with  interest  thereon,  for  each  day  from  and  including  the  date  such
amount  is  distributed  to  it  to  but  excluding  the  date  of  payment  to  the  Agent,  at  the
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

A  notice  of  the  Agent  to  any  Bank  or  the  Borrower  with  respect  to  any  amount  owing

under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

20

Section  2.12        Funding  Losses.  If  the  Borrower  makes  any  payment  of  principal  with
respect to any Term SOFR Loan (pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.15, Article 6 or 8 or otherwise) on
any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower fails
to  borrow  any  Term  SOFR  Loans  after  notice  has  been  given  to  any  Bank  in  accordance  with
Section  2.03(a),  or  if  any  Bank  shall  be  required  to  assign  to  any  other  Bank  any  portion  of  a
Loan pursuant to Section 2.16(b), the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after
demand  for  any  resulting  loss  or  expense  incurred  by  it  (or  by  an  existing  or  prospective
Participant  in  the  related  Loan),  including  (without  limitation)  any  loss  incurred  in  obtaining,
liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period
after any such payment or failure to borrow, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the
Borrower  a  certiﬁcate  as  to  the  amount  of  such  loss  or  expense,  which  certiﬁcate  shall  be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

Section  2.13        Computation  of  Interest  and  Fees.  All  computations  of  interest  for  Base
Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) shall be made on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other
computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days
elapsed  (which  results  in  more  fees  or  interest,  as  applicable,  being  paid  than  if  computed  on
the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan from the day on which the Loan
is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or
such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made
shall  bear  interest  for  one  (1)  day.  Each  determination  by  the  Agent  of  an  interest  rate  or  fee
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

Section 2.14    Taxes.

(a)        Deﬁned  Terms.  For  purposes  of  this  Section  2.14,  the  term  “applicable  Law”

includes FATCA.

(b)    Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.

(i)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes,
except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the
good  faith  discretion  of  the  applicable  Withholding  Agent)  require  the  deduction  or
withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the applicable Withholding Agent,
then  the  applicable  Withholding  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  make  such  deduction  or
withholding,  and  shall  timely  pay  the  full  amount  withheld  or  deducted  to  the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with appliable Law, and if such Tax
is an Indemniﬁed Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as
necessary  so  that  after  any  required  withholding  or  the  making  of  all  required
deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to  additional  sums  payable  under  this
Section 2.14) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

21

(c)        Payment  of  Other  Taxes  by  the  Borrower.  Without  limiting  the  provisions  of
subsection  (a)  above,  the  Borrower  shall  timely  pay  to  the  relevant  Governmental
Authority  in  accordance  with  applicable  Law,  or  at  the  option  of  the  Agent  timely
reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

(d)    Tax Indemniﬁcations.

(i)    The Borrower shall, and does hereby indemnify each Recipient, and shall
make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the
full  amount  of  any  Indemniﬁed  Taxes  (including  Indemniﬁed  Taxes  imposed  or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.14) payable or
paid  by  such  Recipient  or  required  to  be  withheld  or  deducted  from  a  payment  to
such  Recipient,  and  any  penalties,  interest  and  reasonable  expenses  arising
therefrom  or  with  respect  thereto,  whether  or  not  such  Indemniﬁed  Taxes  were
correctly  or  legally  imposed  or  asserted  by  the  relevant  Governmental  Authority.  A
certiﬁcate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by
a Bank (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of
a Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall also, and does
hereby indemnify the Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten
(10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Bank for any reason fails
to pay indefeasibly to the Agent as required pursuant to Section 2.14(d)(ii) below.

(ii)        Each  Bank  shall,  and  does  hereby,  severally  indemnify  and  shall  make
payment  in  respect  thereof  within  ten  (10)  days  after  demand  therefor,  (A)  the
Agent  against  any  Indemniﬁed  Taxes  attributable  to  such  Bank  (but  only  to  the
extent that the Borrower has not already indemniﬁed the Agent for such Indemniﬁed
Taxes  and  without  limiting  the  obligation  of  the  Borrower  to  do  so),  (B)  the  Agent
and  the  Borrower,  as  applicable,  against  any  Taxes  attributable  to  such  Bank’s
failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.06 relating to the maintenance of a
Participant Register (as deﬁned in such Section) and (C) the Agent and the Borrower,
as  applicable,  against  any  Excluded  Taxes  attributable  to  such  Bank,  in  each  case,
that  are  payable  or  paid  by  the  Agent  or  the  Borrower  in  connection  with  this
Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether  or  not  such  Taxes  were  correctly  or  legally  imposed  or  asserted  by  the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certiﬁcate as to the amount of such payment or
liability  delivered  to  any  Bank  by  the  Agent  shall  be  conclusive  absent  manifest
error.  Each  Bank  hereby  authorizes  the  Agent  to  set  oﬀ  and  apply  any  and  all
amounts at any time owing to such Bank under this Agreement against any amount
due to the Agent under this clause (d)(ii).

(e)    Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the Agent, as the case
may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Agent to a Governmental
Authority  as  provided  in  this  Section  2.14,  the  Borrower  shall  deliver  to  the  Agent  or  the
Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certiﬁed copy of
a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such

22

payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence
of  such  payment  reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  Borrower  or  the  Agent,  as  the  case  may
be.

(f)    Status of Banks; Tax Documentation.

(i)        Any  Bank  that  is  entitled  to  an  exemption  from  or  reduction  of
withholding  Tax  with  respect  to  payments  made  under  the  Agreement  shall  deliver
to  the  Borrower  and  the  Agent,  at  the  time  or  times  reasonably  requested  by  the
Borrower  or  the  Agent,  such  properly  completed  and  executed  documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to
be  made  without  withholding  or  at  a  reduced  rate  of  withholding.  In  addition,  any
Bank, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation  prescribed  by  applicable  Law  or  reasonably  requested  by  the
Borrower  or  the  Agent  as  will  enable  the  Borrower  or  the  Agent  to  determine
whether or not such Bank is subject to backup withholding or information reporting
requirements.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  the  preceding  two
sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other
than such documentation set forth in Section 2.14(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below)
shall  not  be  required  if  in  the  Bank’s  reasonable  judgment  such  completion,
execution or submission would subject such Bank to any material unreimbursed cost
or  expense  or  would  materially  prejudice  the  legal  or  commercial  position  of  such
Bank.

(ii)        Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  that  the

Borrower is a U.S. Person,

(A)    any Bank that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Agent on or prior to the date on which such Bank becomes a Bank under this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of
the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 and any other
applicable  documents  certifying  that  such  Bank  is  exempt  from  U.S.  federal
backup withholding tax;

(B)    any Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
deliver  to  the  Borrower  and  the  Agent  (in  such  number  of  copies  as  shall  be
requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank
becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the  reasonable  request  of  the  Borrower  or  the  Agent),  whichever  of  the
following is applicable:

(1)        in  the  case  of  a  Foreign  Bank  claiming  the  beneﬁts  of  an
income  tax  treaty  to  which  the  United  States  is  a  party  (x)  with  respect  to
payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form
W-8BEN-E  (or  W-8BEN,  as  applicable)  establishing  an  exemption  from,  or
reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of
such  tax  treaty  and  (y)  with  respect  to  any  other  applicable  payments  under
any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or

23

W-8BEN,  as  applicable)  establishing  an  exemption  from,  or  reduction  of,  U.S.
federal  withholding  Tax  pursuant  to  the  “business  proﬁts”  or  “other  income”
article of such tax treaty;

(2)    executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;

(3)        in  the  case  of  a  Foreign  Bank  claiming  the  beneﬁts  of  the
exemption  for  portfolio  interest  under  Section  881(c)  of  the  Code,  (x)  a
certiﬁcate  substantially  in  the  form  of  Exhibit  I-1  to  the  eﬀect  that  such
Foreign Bank is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code,  a  “10  percent  shareholder”  of  the  Borrower  within  the  meaning  of
Section  881(c)(3)(B)  of  the  Code,  or  a  “controlled  foreign  corporation”
described  in  Section  881(c)(3)(C)  of  the  Code  (a  “U.S.  Tax  Compliance
Certiﬁcate”)  and  (y)  executed  copies  of  IRS  Form  W-8BEN-E  (or  W-8BEN,  as
applicable); or

(4)        to  the  extent  a  Foreign  Bank  is  not  the  beneﬁcial  owner,
executed  copies  of  IRS  Form  W-8IMY,  accompanied  by  IRS  Form  W-8ECI,  IRS
Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certiﬁcate
substantially  in  the  form  of  Exhibit  I-2  or  Exhibit  I-3,  IRS  Form  W-9,  and/or
other  certiﬁcation  documents  from  each  beneﬁcial  owner,  as  applicable;
provided  that  if  the  Foreign  Bank  is  a  partnership  and  one  or  more  direct  or
indirect  partners  of  such  Foreign  Bank  are  claiming  the  portfolio  interest
exemption, such Foreign Bank may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certiﬁcate
substantially  in  the  form  of  Exhibit  I-4  on  behalf  of  each  such  direct  and
indirect partner;

(C)    any Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
deliver  to  the  Borrower  and  the  Agent  (in  such  number  of  copies  as  shall  be
requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank
becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed copies of any
other  form  prescribed  by  applicable  Law  as  a  basis  for  claiming  exemption
from  or  a  reduction  in  U.S.  federal  withholding  Tax,  duly  completed,  together
with  such  supplementary  documentation  as  may  be  prescribed  by  applicable
Law  to  permit  the  Borrower  or  the  Agent  to  determine  the  withholding  or
deduction required to be made; and

(D)        if  a  payment  made  to  a  Bank  under  the  Agreement  would  be
subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to
fail  to  comply  with  the  applicable  reporting  requirements  of  FATCA  (including
those  contained  in  Section  1471(b)  or  1472(b)  of  the  Code,  as  applicable),
such  Bank  shall  deliver  to  the  Borrower  and  the  Agent  at  the  time  or  times
prescribed  by  law  and  at  such  time  or  times  reasonably  requested  by  the
Borrower  or  the  Agent  such  documentation  prescribed  by  applicable  Law
(including  as  prescribed  by  Section  1471(b)(3)(C)(i)  of  the  Code)  and  such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the

24

Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to
comply  with  their  obligations  under  FATCA  and  to  determine  that  such  Bank
has  complied  with  such  Bank’s  obligations  under  FATCA  or  to  determine  the
amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause  (D),  “FATCA”  shall  include  any  amendments  made  to  FATCA  after  the
date of this Agreement.

(iii)    Each Bank agrees that if any form or certiﬁcation it previously delivered
pursuant  to  this  Section  2.14  expires  or  becomes  obsolete  or  inaccurate  in  any
respect,  it  shall  update  such  form  or  certiﬁcation  or  promptly  notify  the  Borrower
and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(g)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time
shall the Agent have any obligation to ﬁle for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Bank, or
have  any  obligation  to  pay  to  any  Bank,  any  refund  of  Taxes  withheld  or  deducted  from
funds paid for the account of such Bank. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion
exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been
indemniﬁed  by  the  Borrower  or  with  respect  to  which  the  Borrower  has  paid  additional
amounts  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.14,  it  shall  pay  to  the  Borrower  an  amount  equal  to
such  refund  (but  only  to  the  extent  of  indemnity  payments  made,  or  additional  amounts
paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, as
the  case  may  be,  and  without  interest  (other  than  any  interest  paid  by  the  relevant
Governmental  Authority  with  respect  to  such  refund),  provided  that  the  Borrower,  upon
the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority)
to  the  Recipient  in  the  event  the  Recipient  is  required  to  repay  such  refund  to  such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no
event  will  the  applicable  Recipient  be  required  to  pay  any  amount  to  the  Borrower
pursuant  to  this  subsection  the  payment  of  which  would  place  the  Recipient  in  a  less
favorable net after-tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject
to  indemniﬁcation  and  giving  rise  to  such  refund  had  not  been  deducted,  withheld  or
otherwise imposed and the indemniﬁcation payments or additional amounts with respect
to  such  Tax  had  never  been  paid.  This  subsection  shall  not  be  construed  to  require  any
Recipient  to  make  available  its  tax  returns  (or  any  other  information  relating  to  its  taxes
that it deems conﬁdential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

(h)        Survival.  Each  party’s  obligations  under  this  Section  2.14  shall  survive  the
resignation  or  replacement  of  the  Agent  or  any  assignment  of  rights  by,  or  the
replacement  of,  a  Bank,  the  termination  of  the  Aggregate  Commitments  and  the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all of obligations under this Agreement.

Section 2.15    Change of Control; Oﬀer of Prepayment.

(a)    If a Change of Control shall occur (i) the Borrower shall, within ten days after
the  occurrence  thereof,  give  each  Bank  notice  thereof  and  shall  describe  in  reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto and (ii) each Bank may, by three

25

Business  Days’  notice  to  the  Borrower  and  the  Agent,  given  not  later  than  60  days  after
receipt  of  such  notice  of  Change  of  Control,  terminate  its  Commitment,  which  shall
thereupon  be  terminated,  and  declare  all  of  the  outstanding  Loans  made  by  it  (together
with accrued interest thereon) and any other amounts payable hereunder for its account
to  be,  and  such  Loans  and  such  other  amounts  (including,  without  limitation,  amounts
payable  under  Section  2.12)  shall  thereupon  become,  immediately  due  and  payable
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower. For the purpose of this Section, a “Change of Control” shall occur
if,  during  any  period  of  12  consecutive  months,  (I)  a  majority  of  the  directors  of  the
Borrower  shall  be  Persons  other  than  Persons  (A)  who  were  directors  of  the  Borrower  on
the ﬁrst day of such period, (B) whose election or nomination as a director of the Borrower
was  approved  by  individuals  referred  to  in  clause  (A)  constituting  at  the  time  of  such
election or nomination at least a majority of the Board of Directors, or (C) whose election
or  nomination  as  a  director  of  the  Borrower  was  approved  by  individuals  referred  to  in
clauses  (A)  or  (B)  above  or  this  clause  (C)  constituting  at  the  time  of  such  election  or
nomination  at  least  a  majority  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  (II)  any  person  or  group  of
persons (within the meaning of Section 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act) shall have acquired
beneﬁcial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  under  the  Exchange  Act)  of  50%  or  more  in  voting  power  of  the
outstanding Voting Stock.

(b)        If  any  event  or  condition  shall  occur  under  any  agreement,  indenture  or
instrument relating to any Material Debt (other than an event or condition arising due to
the  Borrower’s  exercise  of  an  optional  right  to  prepay,  redeem,  purchase  or  defease),
which event or condition has the eﬀect of requiring an oﬀer of prepayment, redemption,
purchase or defeasance to be made to the holders of such Material Debt (a “Prepayment
Oﬀer”),  (i)  the  Borrower  will,  within  ten  days  after  the  ﬁrst  day  that  such  event  or
condition occurs, give each Bank notice thereof and shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts  and  circumstances  giving  rise  thereto  and  (ii)  each  Bank  may,  by  three  Business
Days’ notice to the Borrower and the Agent, given not later than 60 days after receipt of
such  notice  of  Prepayment  Oﬀer,  terminate  its  Commitment,  which  shall  thereupon  be
terminated,  and  declare  all  of  the  outstanding  Loans  made  by  it  (together  with  accrued
interest  thereon)  and  any  other  amounts  payable  hereunder  for  its  account  to  be,  and
such Loans and such other amounts (including, without limitation, amounts payable under
Section  2.12)  shall  thereupon  become, 
immediately  due  and  payable  without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived
by the Borrower.

Section 2.16    Increase in Combined Commitments.

(a)    The Borrower shall have the right, without the consent of the Banks, subject to
the  terms  of  this  Section  2.16,  to  eﬀectuate  from  time  to  time,  at  any  time  prior  to  the
then  eﬀective  Termination  Date,  an  increase  in  the  combined  Commitments  under  this
Agreement  by  adding  to  this  Agreement  one  or  more  other  banks  or  other  ﬁnancial
institutions  reasonably  acceptable  to  the  Agent  and  the  Borrower  and  qualifying  as  an
Assignee hereunder, who shall, upon completion of the requirements of this Section 2.16
constitute  “Banks”  hereunder  (an  “Added  Bank”),  or  by  allowing  one  or  more  Banks  in
their  sole  discretion  to  increase  their  respective  Commitments  hereunder  (each  an
“Increasing  Bank”),  so  that  such  added  and  increased  Commitments  shall  equal  the
increase in Commitments eﬀectuated pursuant to this Section 2.16; provided that (i) there
shall not be any increased Commitment or any added Commitment, unless the aggregate
increase  or  addition  to  be  eﬀected  is  at  least  $25,000,000,  (ii)  no  increase  in  or  added
Commitments  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.16  shall  result  in  combined  Commitments
exceeding  $1,500,000,000,  (iii)  no  Bank’s  Commitment  shall  be  increased  under  this
Section 2.16 without the consent of such Bank, and (iv) there shall not exist any Default or
Event  of  Default  immediately  prior  to  and  immediately  after  giving  eﬀect  to  such
increased or added Commitment. The Borrower shall deliver or pay, as applicable, to the
Agent not later than ten Business Days prior to any such increase in Commitments each of
the following items with respect to each Added Bank and Increasing Bank:

(i)        a  written  notice  of  Borrower’s  intention  to  increase  the  combined
Commitments  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.16,  which  shall  specify  each  Added  Bank
and  Increasing  Bank,  if  any,  the  changes  in  amounts  of  Commitments  that  will
result, and such other information as is reasonably requested by the Agent;

(ii)    documents in the form of Exhibit B or Exhibit C, as may be required by
the Agent, executed and delivered by each Added Bank and each Increasing Bank,
pursuant  to  which  it  becomes  a  party  hereto  or  increases  its  Commitment,  as  the
case may be;

(iii)    if requested by the applicable Bank, Notes or replacement Notes, as the

case may be, executed and delivered by Borrower; and

(iv)    a non-refundable processing fee of $3,500 with respect to each Added

Bank or Increasing Bank for the sole account of the Agent.

(b)        Upon  receipt  of  any  notice  referred  to  in  clause  (a)(i)  above,  the  Agent  shall
promptly  notify  each  Bank  thereof.  Upon  execution  and  delivery  of  such  documents  and
the payment of such fee (the “Increased Commitment Date”), each such Added Bank
shall  constitute  a  “Bank”  for  all  purposes  under  this  Agreement  and  related  documents
without any acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Banks, with a Commitment as
speciﬁed  in  such  documents,  or  such  Bank’s  Commitment  shall  increase  as  speciﬁed  in
such documents, as the case may be. Immediately upon the eﬀectiveness of the addition
of such Added Bank or the increase in the Commitment of such Increasing Bank under this
Section 2.16, (i) the respective pro rata shares of the Banks shall be deemed modiﬁed as
appropriate

27

to correspond to such changed combined Commitments, and (ii) if there are at such time
outstanding any Loans, each Bank whose pro rata share has been decreased as a result of
the  increase  in  the  combined  Commitments  shall  be  deemed  to  have  assigned,  without
recourse, to each Added Bank and Increasing Bank such portion of such Bank’s Loans as
shall be necessary to eﬀectuate such adjustment in pro rata shares. Each Increasing Bank
and  Added  Bank  (x)  shall  be  deemed  to  have  assumed  such  portion  of  such  Loans  and
(y) shall fund to each other Bank on the Increased Commitment Date the amount of Loans
assigned by it to such Bank. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Banks on demand any and
all  amounts  to  the  extent  payable  pursuant  to  Section  2.12  as  a  result  of  any  such
prepayment  of  Loans  occasioned  by  the  foregoing  increase  in  Commitments  and  the
reallocation of the pro rata shares.

(c)    This section shall supersede any provisions in Section 9.06(b) to the contrary.

Section 2.17    Term Out Option.

The Borrower may, upon notice to the Agent not later than the Termination Date, elect to
convert  all  of  the  Loans  outstanding  on  the  Termination  Date  in  eﬀect  at  such  time  into  “term
loans” in which case the outstanding Loans shall not be due on the Termination Date and shall
instead  be  due  and  payable  on  the  ﬁrst  anniversary  of  the  Termination  Date,  with  the  eﬀect
that,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Agreement  or  in  any  other  Loan
Document, all references in this Agreement and each other Loan Document to the Termination
Date (other than as set forth in this Section 2.17) shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the date
that  is  the  ﬁrst  anniversary  of  the  Termination  Date;  provided  that  (a)  the  Borrower  shall  have
delivered  an  oﬃcer’s  certiﬁcate  dated  as  of  the  Termination  Date  certifying  (x)  that
representations  and  warranties  contained  in  Article  IV  are  true  and  correct  in  all  material
respects on and as of such date (except where any such representation or warranty is otherwise
qualiﬁed by materiality, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct
in  all  respects  and  except  to  the  extent  that  such  representations  and  warranties  speciﬁcally
refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date), (b) no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (c) the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent
for  the  account  of  the  Banks  a  fee  in  the  amount  equal  to  (x)  0.50%  multiplied  by  (y)  the
aggregate  outstanding  principal  amount  of  all  Loans  so  converted.  All  Loans  converted  into
“term  loans”  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.17  shall  continue  to  constitute  Loans  under  this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (i) except that the Borrower may not reborrow such
Loans  pursuant  to  Section  2.01  after  all  or  any  portion  of  such  Loans  shall  have  been  prepaid
pursuant to Section 2.10 and no new Loans may be borrowed on or after the Termination Date
and (ii) the Borrower may prepay such Loans in whole or in part at any time without premium or
penalty in accordance with Section 2.10.

Section 2.18    Defaulting Banks.

(a)        Adjustments.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this
Agreement, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, then, until such time as that Bank is
no longer a Defaulting Bank, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:

28

(i)        Waivers  and  Amendments.  That  Defaulting  Bank’s  right  to  approve  or
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in Section 9.05.

(ii)        Reallocation  of  Payments.  Any  payment  of  principal,  interest,  fees  or
other  amounts  received  by  the  Agent  for  the  account  of  that  Defaulting  Bank
(whether  voluntary  or  mandatory,  at  maturity,  pursuant  to  Article  6  or  otherwise,
and  including  any  amounts  made  available  to  the  Agent  by  that  Defaulting  Bank
pursuant  to  Section  9.04,  but  excluding  any  amounts  received  from  the  Borrower
under Section 2.03(c)), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined
by  the  Agent  as  follows:  ﬁrst,  to  the  payment  of  any  amounts  owing  by  that
Defaulting  Bank  to  the  Agent  hereunder;  second,  as  the  Borrower  may  request  (so
long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect
of  which  that  Defaulting  Bank  has  failed  to  fund  its  portion  thereof  as  required  by
this  Agreement,  as  determined  by  the  Agent;  third,  if  so  determined  by  the  Agent
and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released
in  order  to  satisfy  obligations  of  that  Defaulting  Bank  to  fund  Loans  under  this
Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Banks as a result of
any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Bank against that
Defaulting Bank as a result of that Defaulting Bank’s breach of its obligations under
this  Agreement;  ﬁfth,  so  long  as  no  Default  or  Event  of  Default  exists,  to  the
payment  of  any  amounts  owing  to  the  Borrower  as  a  result  of  any  judgment  of  a
court  of  competent  jurisdiction  obtained  by  the  Borrower  against  that  Defaulting
Bank  as  a  result  of  that  Defaulting  Bank’s  breach  of  its  obligations  under  this
Agreement; and sixth, to that Defaulting Bank or as otherwise directed by a court of
competent  jurisdiction;  provided,  however,  notwithstanding  the  foregoing  clauses
ﬁrst through sixth, if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any
Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Bank has not fully funded its appropriate
share  and  (y)  such  Loans  were  made  at  a  time  when  the  conditions  set  forth  in
Section 3.02 were satisﬁed or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay
the  Loans  of  all  non-Defaulting  Banks  on  a  pro  rata  basis  prior  to  being  applied  to
the payment of any Loans of that Defaulting Bank. Any payments, prepayments or
other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Bank that are applied (or held) to pay
amounts  owed  by  a  Defaulting  Bank  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.18(a)(ii)  shall  be
deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Bank, and each Bank irrevocably
consents hereto.

(iii)        Certain  Fees.  That  Defaulting  Bank  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  any
facility  fee  pursuant  to  Section  2.07  for  any  period  during  which  that  Bank  is  a
Defaulting  Bank  only  to  extent  allocable  to  the  outstanding  principal  amount  of
Loans  funded  by  it  (and  the  Borrower  shall  not  be  required  to  pay  the  remaining
amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to
that Defaulting Bank).

(b)    Defaulting Bank Cure. If the Borrower and the Agent agree in writing in their
sole  discretion  that  a  Defaulting  Bank  should  no  longer  be  deemed  to  be  a  Defaulting
Bank, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the eﬀective date

29

speciﬁed in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Bank will, to
the  extent  applicable,  purchase  that  portion  of  outstanding  Loans  of  the  other  Banks  or
take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans
to be held on a pro rata basis by the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments,
whereupon that Bank will cease to be a Defaulting Bank; provided that no adjustments will
be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of
the Borrower while that Bank was a Defaulting Bank; and provided, further, that except to
the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the aﬀected parties, no change hereunder from
Defaulting  Bank  to  Bank  will  constitute  a  waiver  or  release  of  any  claim  of  any  party
hereunder arising from that Bank’s having been a Defaulting Bank.

Section 2.19    Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced by one
or more accounts or records maintained by such Bank and by the Agent in the ordinary course
of  business.  Any  failure  to  so  record  or  any  error  in  doing  so  shall  not,  however,  limit  or
otherwise aﬀect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect
to  its  obligations  hereunder.  In  the  event  of  any  conﬂict  between  the  accounts  and  records
maintained by any Bank and the accounts and records of the Agent in respect of such matters,
the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Borrower represents and warrants that:

Section 4.01    Corporate Existence and Power; Investment Company Status. Each of the
Borrower and each of its Signiﬁcant Subsidiaries is validly existing and in good standing under
the  laws  of  its  jurisdiction  of  organization,  and  is  duly  qualiﬁed  to  do  business  in  each
jurisdiction where, in light of the nature of the business transacted or the property owned by it,
such qualiﬁcation is necessary, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualiﬁed would
not  reasonably  be  expected  to  result  in  a  material  adverse  eﬀect  on  the  business,  ﬁnancial
position  or  results  of  operations  of  the  Borrower  and  its  Signiﬁcant  Subsidiaries  taken  as  a
whole. The Borrower is not nor is required to be registered as an “investment company” under
the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Section  4.02        Corporate  and  Governmental  Authorization;  No  Contravention.  The
execution,  delivery  and  performance  by  the  Borrower  of  this  Agreement  and  the  Notes,  if  any,

corporate  action,  require  no  action  by  or  in  respect  of,  or  ﬁling  with,  any  governmental  body,
agency  or  oﬃcial  and  do  not  contravene,  or  constitute  a  default  under,  any  provision  of
applicable Law or regulation or of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or of
any  agreement  or  instrument  evidencing  or  governing  Debt  of  the  Borrower  or  any  other
material  agreement,  judgment,  injunction,  order,  decree  or  other  instrument  binding  upon  the
Borrower or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any

Section 4.03    Binding Eﬀect. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of  the  Borrower  and  the  Notes,  if  any,  when  executed  and  delivered  in  accordance  with  this
Agreement,  will  constitute  valid  and  binding  obligations  of  the  Borrower  in  each  case
enforceable  in  accordance  with  their  respective  terms,  except  as  (i)  the  enforceability  thereof
may  be  limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  similar  laws  aﬀecting  creditors’  rights  generally
and  (ii)  rights  of  acceleration  and  the  availability  of  equitable  remedies  may  be  limited  by
equitable principles of general applicability.

Section 4.04    Financial Information. The consolidated statements of ﬁnancial position of
the  Borrower  and  its  Consolidated  Subsidiaries  as  of  January  28,  2023  and  the  related

the  ﬁscal  year  then  ended,  reported  on  by  Ernst  &  Young,  LLP  and  set  forth  in  the  Borrower’s
Form  10-K  for  the  ﬁscal  year  then  ended,  a  copy  of  which  has  been  delivered  to  each  of  the

principles, the consolidated ﬁnancial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries
as of such date and their consolidated results of operations and cash ﬂows for such ﬁscal year.

Section 4.05    Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the
knowledge  of  the  Borrower  threatened  against,  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  before

expected to materially adversely aﬀect the business, consolidated ﬁnancial position or

32

consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries or which in
any manner draws into question the validity of this Agreement or any Note.

Section 4.06    Compliance with ERISA. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has fulﬁlled its
obligations,  if  any,  under  the  minimum  funding  standards  of  ERISA  with  respect  to  each  Plan
maintained  by  it,  and  each  Plan  is  otherwise  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  provisions  of
ERISA,  except  in  each  case,  as  could  not  reasonably  be  expected,  either  individually  or  in  the
aggregate,  to  have  a  material  adverse  eﬀect  on  the  business,  ﬁnancial  position  or  results  of
operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 4.07    Payment of Taxes. United States Federal income tax returns of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries have been examined and closed through the ﬁscal year ended January 30,
2021. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have ﬁled all United States Federal income tax returns
and all other material tax returns which, to the best of the Borrower’s knowledge, are required
to  be  ﬁled  by  them  and  have  paid  all  taxes  due  pursuant  to  such  returns  or  pursuant  to  any
assessment  received  by  the  Borrower  or  any  Subsidiary,  except  (i)  as  could  not  reasonably  be

satisfactory  to  the  Agent,  the  full  and  timely  performance  and  observance  of  every  covenant
and agreement contained herein, including but not limited to the payment of the principal and

Section  7.02        Agent  and  Aﬃliates.  Bank  of  America  shall  have  the  same  rights  and
powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the
same  as  though  it  were  not  the  Agent,  and  Bank  of  America  and  its  aﬃliates  may  accept
deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower
or  any  Subsidiary  or  aﬃliate  of  the  Borrower  as  if  it  were  not  the  Agent  hereunder.  The  Banks
acknowledge  that,  pursuant  to  such  activities,  Bank  of  America  or  its  aﬃliates  may  receive
information regarding the Borrower or its aﬃliates (including information that may be subject to
conﬁdentiality  obligations  in  favor  of  the  Borrower  or  such  aﬃliate)  and  acknowledge  that  the
Agent  shall  be  under  no  obligation  to  provide  such  information  to  them.  With  respect  to  its
Loans,  Bank  of  America  shall  have  the  same  rights  and  powers  under  this  Agreement  as  any
other Bank and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Agent, and the
terms “Bank” and “Banks” include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

Section  7.03        Action  by  Agent.  The  obligations  of  the  Agent  hereunder  are  only  those
expressly  set  forth  herein,  and  the  Agent  shall  not  be  a  trustee  or  ﬁduciary  for  any  Bank;  the
term  “Agent”  is  used  solely  as  a  matter  of  market  custom  to  connote  an  administrative
relationship  among  independent  contracting  parties.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the
foregoing, the Agent shall not be required to take any action with respect to any Default, except
as expressly provided in Article 6.

Section 7.04    Consultation with Experts. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may  be  counsel  for  the  Borrower),  independent  public  accountants  and  other  experts  selected
by  it  and  shall  not  be  liable  for  any  action  taken  or  omitted  to  be  taken  by  it  in  good  faith  in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

Section 7.05    Liability of Agent. Neither the Agent nor any of its aﬃliates nor any of their
respective  directors,  oﬃcers,  agents  or  employees  shall  be  liable  for  any  action  taken  or  not
taken by it in connection herewith (a) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks
or  all  Banks,  as  the  case  may  be,  or  (b)  in  the  absence  of  its  own  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct and in no event shall any such Person be liable for special, consequential, punitive
or  indirect  damages.  Neither  the  Agent  nor  any  of  its  aﬃliates  nor  any  of  their  respective
directors, oﬃcers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain,
inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this
Agreement  or  any  borrowing  hereunder;  (ii)  the  performance  or  observance  of  any  of  the
covenants  or  agreements  of  the  Borrower;  (iii)  the  satisfaction  of  any  condition  speciﬁed  in
Article  3,  except  receipt  of  items  required  to  be  delivered  to  the  Agent;  or  (iv)  the  validity,
enforceability, eﬀectiveness, genuineness or suﬃciency of this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or
any other instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith. Neither the Agent nor any of
its aﬃliates nor any of their respective directors, oﬃcers, agents or employees shall be required
to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings under this Agreement or the Notes,
if  any.  The  Agent  shall  not  incur  any  liability  by  acting  in  reliance  upon  any  notice,  consent,
certiﬁcate,  statement,  or  other  writing  (which  may  be  a  bank  wire,  telex  or  similar  writing)
believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.

Section  7.06        Indemniﬁcation.  Each  Bank  shall,  ratably  in  accordance  with  its
Commitment (determined at the time such indemniﬁcation is sought), indemnify the Agent, its
aﬃliates  and  their  respective  directors,  oﬃcers,  agent  and  employees  (to  the  extent  not
reimbursed  by  the  Borrower)  from  and  against  all  Indemniﬁed  Liabilities,  as  deﬁned  in
Section  9.03(b)  (except  such  as  result  from  such  indemnitees’  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct;  provided,  however,  that  no  action  taken  in  accordance  with  directions  of  the
Required Banks or, in the case of an action expressly requiring the consent of all of the Banks,
with the directions of all of the Banks, shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct  for  purposes  of  this  Section),  that  such  indemnitees  may  suﬀer  or  incur  in
connection  with  this  Agreement  or  as  a  result  of  any  action  taken  or  omitted  by  such
indemnitees  hereunder.  Without  limitation  of  the  foregoing,  each  Bank  shall  reimburse  the
Agent  upon  demand  for  its  ratable  share  (determined  at  the  time  such  reimbursement  is
sought)  of  any  costs  or  out-of-pocket  expenses  (including  reasonable  fees  and  expenses  of
counsel,  including  the  allocated  costs  of  internal  legal  services)  incurred  by  the  Agent  in
connection  with  the  preparation,  execution,  delivery,  administration,  modiﬁcation,  amendment
or  enforcement  (whether  through  negotiations,  legal  proceedings  or  otherwise)  of,  or  legal
advice  in  respect  of  rights  or  responsibilities  under,  this  Agreement  or  any  document
contemplated by or

41

referred  to  herein,  to  the  extent  that  the  Agent  is  not  reimbursed  for  such  expenses  by  or  on
behalf  of  the  Borrower.  The  undertaking  in  this  Section  shall  survive  termination  of  the
Commitments, the repayment of all Loans and the resignation of the Agent.

Section  7.07        Credit  Decision.  Each  Bank  acknowledges  that  it  has,  independently  and
without  reliance  upon  the  Agent,  any  Co-Documentation  Agent,  the  Syndication  Agent  or  any
other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also acknowledges
that  it  will,  independently  and  without  reliance  upon  the  Agent,  any  Co-Documentation  Agent,
the  Syndication  Agent  or  any  other  Bank,  and  based  on  such  documents  and  information  as  it
shall  deem  appropriate  at  the  time,  continue  to  make  its  own  credit  decisions  in  taking  or  not
taking any action under this Agreement.

Section  7.08        Successor  Agent.  The  Agent  may  resign  at  any  time  by  giving  notice
thereof  to  the  Banks  and  the  Borrower.  Upon  any  such  resignation,  the  Required  Banks  shall
have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a
successor  Agent.  If  no  successor  Agent  shall  have  been  so  appointed  by  the  Required  Banks,
and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice
of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent,
which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of
America  or  of  any  State  thereof  and  having  a  combined  capital  and  surplus  of  at  least
$50,000,000.  Upon  the  acceptance  of  its  appointment  as  Agent  hereunder  by  a  successor
Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights
and  duties  of  the  retiring  Agent,  and  the  retiring  Agent  shall  thereafter  be  discharged  from  its
duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent’s resignation hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Article shall inure to its beneﬁt as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Agent.

Section 7.09    Agent’s Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for its own account fees

in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon between the Borrower and the Agent.

Section  7.10        Co-Documentation  Agents  and  Syndication  Agent.  Nothing  in  this
Agreement  shall  impose  on  any  Co-Documentation  Agent  or  the  Syndication  Agent,  in  its
capacity as such, any duties or obligations whatsoever, nor shall any Co-Documentation Agent
or the Syndication Agent, in its capacity as such be deemed to have any ﬁduciary relationship
with any Bank.

Section  7.11        Defaults.  The  Agent  shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  knowledge  or  notice  of
the  occurrence  of  a  Default  or  Event  of  Default  unless  the  Agent  has  received  written  notice
from  a  Bank  or  the  Borrower  specifying  such  Default  or  Event  of  Default  and  stating  that  such
notice  is  a  “Notice  of  Default”.  In  the  event  that  the  Agent  receives  such  a  notice  of  the
occurrence  of  a  Default  or  Event  of  Default,  the  Agent  shall  give  prompt  notice  thereof  to  the
Banks.  The  Agent  shall  (subject  to  Section  7.05  hereof)  take  such  action  with  respect  to  such
Default  or  Event  of  Default  as  shall  reasonably  be  directed  by  the  Required  Banks,  provided
that,  unless  and  until  the  Agent  shall  have  received  such  directions,  the  Agent  may  (but  shall
not  be  obligated  to)  take  such  action,  or  refrain  from  taking  such  action,  with  respect  to  such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Banks.

42

Section 7.12    Recovery of Erroneous Payments.

Without  limitation  of  any  other  provision  in  this  Agreement,  if  at  any  time  the  Agent
makes a payment hereunder in error to any Bank, whether or not in respect of an obligation due
and owing by the Borrower at such time, where such payment is a Rescindable Amount, then in
any  such  event,  each  Bank  receiving  a  Rescindable  Amount  severally  agrees  to  repay  to  the
Agent  forthwith  on  demand  the  Rescindable  Amount  received  by  such  Bank  in  immediately
available  funds  in  the  currency  so  received,  with  interest  thereon,  for  each  day  from  and
including  the  date  such  Rescindable  Amount  is  received  by  it  to  but  excluding  the  date  of
payment  to  the  Agent,  at  the  greater  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate  and  a  rate  determined  by  the
Agent  in  accordance  with  banking  industry  rules  on  interbank  compensation.  Each  Bank
irrevocably  waives  any  and  all  defenses,  including  any  “discharge  for  value”  (under  which  a
creditor might otherwise claim a right to retain funds mistakenly paid by a third party in respect
of  a  debt  owed  by  another)  or  similar  defense  to  its  obligation  to  return  any  Rescindable
Amount. The Agent shall inform each Bank promptly upon determining that any payment made
to such Bank comprised, in whole or in part, a Rescindable Amount.

ARTICLE 8
CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

Section 8.01    Inability to Determine Rates.

(a)    If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion of Base
Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or a continuation of any of such Loans, as applicable, (i)
the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that
(A)  no  Successor  Rate  has  been  determined  in  accordance  with  Section  8.01(b),  and  the
circumstances under clause (i) of Section 8.01(b) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has
occurred,  or  (B)  adequate  and  reasonable  means  do  not  otherwise  exist  for  determining
Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan
or  in  connection  with  an  existing  or  proposed  Base  Rate  Loan,  or  (ii)  the  Agent  or  the
Required Banks determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest
Period with respect to a proposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reﬂect the cost to
such Banks of funding such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each
Bank.

Thereafter,  (x)  the  obligation  of  the  Banks  to  make  or  maintain  Term  SOFR  Loans,  or  to
convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the aﬀected
Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the
preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization
of  the  Term  SOFR  component  in  determining  the  Base  Rate  shall  be  suspended,  in  each  case
until the Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Banks described in clause (ii)
of  this  Section  8.01(a),  until  the  Agent  upon  instruction  of  the  Required  Banks)  revokes  such
notice.

Upon  receipt  of  such  notice,  (i)  the  Borrower  may  revoke  any  pending  request  for  a
Borrowing of, or conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the aﬀected
Term  SOFR  Loans  or  Interest  Periods)  or,  failing  that,  shall  be  deemed  to  have  converted  such
request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount speciﬁed therein and
(ii)

43

any outstanding Term SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans
immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period.

(b)    Replacement of Term SOFR or Successor Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Agent determines (which
determination  shall  be  conclusive  absent  manifest  error),  or  the  Borrower  or  Required
Banks notify the Agent (with, in the case of the Required Banks, a copy to the Borrower)
that the Borrower or Required Banks (as applicable) have determined, that:

(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three
month  and  six-month  interest  periods  of  Term  SOFR,  including,  without  limitation,
because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis
and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or

(ii)        CME  or  any  successor  administrator  of  the  Term  SOFR  Screen  Rate  or  a
Governmental  Authority  having  jurisdiction  over  the  Agent  or  such  administrator
with  respect  to  its  publication  of  Term  SOFR,  in  each  case  acting  in  such  capacity,
has  made  a  public  statement  identifying  a  speciﬁc  date  after  which  one  month,
three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen
Rate  shall  or  will  no  longer  be  made  available,  or  permitted  to  be  used  for
determining the interest rate of Dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will
otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor
administrator  that  is  satisfactory  to  the  Agent,  that  will  continue  to  provide  such
interest periods of Term SOFR after such speciﬁc date (the latest date on which one
month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR
Screen  Rate  are  no  longer  available  permanently  or  indeﬁnitely,  the  “Scheduled
Unavailability Date”);

then, on a date and time determined by the Agent (any such date, the “Term SOFR
Replacement Date”), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the
relevant  interest  payment  date,  as  applicable,  for  interest  calculated  and,  solely
with  respect  to  clause  (ii)  above,  no  later  than  the  Scheduled  Unavailability  Date,
Term  SOFR  will  be  replaced  hereunder  and  under  any  Loan  Document  with  Daily
Simple  SOFR  plus  the  SOFR  Adjustment  for  any  payment  period  for  interest
calculated  that  can  be  determined  by  the  Agent,  in  each  case,  without  any
amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or
any other Loan Document (the “Successor Rate”).

If  the  Successor  Rate  is  Daily  Simple  SOFR  plus  the  SOFR  Adjustment,  all  interest

payments will be payable on a quarterly basis.

Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  (i)  if  the  Agent  determines  that  Daily
Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events
or circumstances of the type described in Section 8.01(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to
the  Successor  Rate  then  in  eﬀect,  then  in  each  case,  the  Agent  and  the  Borrower  may  amend
this  Agreement  solely  for  the  purpose  of  replacing  Term  SOFR  or  any  then  current  Successor
Rate  in  accordance  with  this  Section  8.01  at  the  end  of  any  Interest  Period,  relevant  interest
payment date

44

or  payment  period  for  interest  calculated,  as  applicable,  with  an  alternative  benchmark  rate
giving  due  consideration  to  any  evolving  or  then  existing  convention  for  similar  Dollar
denominated  credit  facilities  syndicated  and  agented  in  the  United  States  for  such  alternative
benchmark.  and,  in  each  case,  including  any  mathematical  or  other  adjustments  to  such
benchmark  giving  due  consideration  to  any  evolving  or  then  existing  convention  for  similar
Dollar  denominated  credit  facilities  syndicated  and  agented  in  the  United  States  for  such
benchmark.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  any  such  proposed  rate  and  adjustments,  shall
constitute  a  “Successor  Rate”.  Any  such  amendment  shall  become  eﬀective  at  5:00  p.m.  on
the ﬁfth Business Day after the Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Banks
and  the  Borrower  unless,  prior  to  such  time,  Banks  comprising  the  Required  Banks  have
delivered to the Agent written notice that such Required Banks object to such amendment.

The Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Bank of the

implementation of any Successor Rate.

Any  Successor  Rate  shall  be  applied  in  a  manner  consistent  with  market  practice;
provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Agent,
such  Successor  Rate  shall  be  applied  in  a  manner  as  otherwise  reasonably  determined  by  the
Agent.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined
would  otherwise  be  less  than  0.00%,  the  Successor  Rate  shall  be  deemed  to  be  0.00%  for  the
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Agent will have the right
to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein  or  in  any  other  Loan  Document,  any  amendments  implementing  such  Conforming
Changes will become eﬀective without any further action or consent of any other party to this
Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment eﬀected, the Agent shall post
each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Banks
reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes eﬀective.

Section  8.02        Illegality.  If,  on  or  after  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  the  adoption  of  any
applicable  Law,  rule  or  regulation,  or  any  change  in  any  applicable  Law,  rule  or  regulation,  or
any  change  in  the  interpretation  or  administration  thereof  by  any  Governmental  Authority
charged  with  the  interpretation  or  administration  thereof  or  compliance  by  any  Bank  (or  its
Lending  Oﬃce)  with  any  request  or  directive  (whether  or  not  having  the  force  of  law)  of  any
such  Governmental  Authority  shall  make  it  unlawful  or  impossible  for  any  Bank  (or  its  Lending
Oﬃce)  to  make,  maintain  or  fund  its  Loans  whose  interest  rate  is  determined  by  reference  to
SOFR  or  Term  SOFR,  or  to  determine  or  charge  interest  rates  based  upon  SOFR  or  Term  SOFR,
and  such  Bank  shall  so  notify  the  Agent,  the  Agent  shall  forthwith  give  notice  thereof  to  the
other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notiﬁes the Borrower and the Agent
that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (a) the obligation of such
Bank to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans
shall  be  suspended  and  (b)  if  such  notice  asserts  the  illegality  of  such  Bank  making  or
maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term
SOFR  component  of  the  Base  Rate,  the  interest  rate  on  which  Base  Rate  Loans  of  such  Bank
shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the
Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in

45

each  case  until  such  Bank  notiﬁes  the  Agent  and  the  Borrower  that  the  circumstances  giving
rise to such determination no longer exist. Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this
Section,  such  Bank  shall  designate  a  diﬀerent  Lending  Oﬃce  if  such  designation  will  avoid  the
need  for  giving  such  notice  and  will  not,  in  the  judgment  of  such  Bank,  be  otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to
maintain  and  fund  any  of  its  outstanding  Term  SOFR  Loans  to  maturity  and  shall  so  specify  in
such notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount
of  each  such  Term  SOFR  Loan,  together  with  accrued  interest  thereon.  Concurrently  with
prepaying each such Term SOFR Loan, the Borrower shall, subject to Section 2.01, borrow a Base
Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be
payable  contemporaneously  with  the  related  Term  SOFR  Loans  of  the  other  Banks),  and  such
Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

Section 8.03    Increased Cost and Reduced Return.

(a)    If on or after the date hereof in the case of any Loan or any obligation to make
Loans,  the  adoption  of  any  applicable  Law,  rule  or  regulation,  or  any  change  in  any
applicable  Law,  rule  or  regulation,  or  any  change  in  the  interpretation  or  administration
thereof  by  any  Governmental  Authority  charged  with  the  interpretation  or  administration
thereof  or  compliance  by  any  Bank  (or  its  Lending  Oﬃce)  with  any  request  or  directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority:

(i)        shall  subject  any  Bank  (or  its  Lending  Oﬃce)  to  any  tax,  duty  or  other
charge with respect to its Term SOFR Loans, its Note, if any, or its obligation to make
Term SOFR Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank (or
its Lending Oﬃce) of the principal of or interest on its Term SOFR Loans or any other
amounts  due  under  this  Agreement  in  respect  of  its  Term  SOFR  Loans  or  its
obligation  to  make  Term  SOFR  Loans  (except  for  changes  in  the  rate  of  tax  on  the
overall net income of such Bank or its Lending Oﬃce imposed by the jurisdiction in
which such Bank’s principal executive oﬃce or Lending Oﬃce is located) and except
for any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA; or

(ii)    shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without
limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve  System),  special  deposit,  or  insurance  assessment  or  shall  impose  on  any
Bank  (or  its  Lending  Oﬃce)  any  other  condition  aﬀecting  its  Term  SOFR  Loans,  its
Note, if any, or its obligation to make Term SOFR Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Lending
Oﬃce)  of  making,  converting  to,  continuing  or  maintaining  any  Term  SOFR  Loan  (or
maintaining  its  obligation  to  make  any  such  Loan),  or  to  reduce  the  amount  of  any  sum
received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending Oﬃce) under this Agreement or under
its Note, if any, with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material,
then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower
shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank
for such increased cost or reduction.

46

(b)    If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof the adoption of
any  applicable  Law,  rule  or  regulation  regarding  capital  adequacy  or 
liquidity
requirements,  or  any  change  in  any  such  law,  rule  or  regulation,  or  any  change  in  the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof  by  any  Governmental  Authority  charged  with  the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof  or  any  request  or  directive  regarding  capital
adequacy  or  liquidity  requirements  (whether  or  not  having  the  force  of  law)  of  any  such
Governmental  Authority  has  or  would  have  the  eﬀect  of  reducing  the  rate  of  return  on
capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank’s obligations hereunder
to  a  level  below  that  which  such  Bank  (or  its  Parent)  could  have  achieved  but  for  such
adoption,  change,  request  or  directive  (taking  into  consideration  its  policies  with  respect
to  capital  adequacy  and  liquidity)  by  an  amount  deemed  by  such  Bank  to  be  material,
then  from  time  to  time,  within  15  days  after  demand  by  such  Bank  (with  a  copy  to  the
Agent),  the  Borrower  shall  pay  to  such  Bank  such  additional  amount  or  amounts  as  will
compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction.

(c)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform  and  Consumer  Protection  Act  and  all  requests,  rules,  guidelines  or  directives
thereunder  or  issued  in  connection  therewith  and  (ii)  all  requests,  rules,  guidelines  or
directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory
authorities,  in  each  case  pursuant  to  Basel  III,  shall  in  each  case  be  deemed  to  be  a
change  in  law  contemplated  by  the  foregoing  clauses  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  Section  8.03,
regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.

(d)        Each  Bank  will  promptly  notify  the  Borrower  and  the  Agent  of  any  event  of
which  it  has  knowledge,  occurring  after  the  date  hereof  which  will  entitle  such  Bank  to
compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a diﬀerent Lending Oﬃce if such
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of such compensation and will
not,  in  the  judgment  of  such  Bank,  be  otherwise  disadvantageous  to  such  Bank.  A
certiﬁcate  of  any  Bank  claiming  compensation  under  this  Section  and  setting  forth  the
additional  amount  or  amounts  to  be  paid  to  it  hereunder  shall  be  conclusive  in  the
absence  of  manifest  error.  In  determining  such  amount,  such  Bank  may  use  any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

Section  8.04        Base  Rate  Loans  Substituted  for  Aﬀected  Term  SOFR  Loans.  If  (a)  the
obligation  of  any  Bank  to  make,  maintain  or  convert  to  Term  SOFR  Loans  has  been  suspended
pursuant to Section 8.02 or (b) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 and
the Borrower shall, by at least ﬁve Business Days’ prior notice to such Bank through the Agent,
have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until
such  Bank  notiﬁes  the  Borrower  that  the  circumstances  giving  rise  to  such  suspension  or
demand for compensation no longer exist:

(x)        all  Loans  which  would  otherwise  be  made,  maintained  or  converted  by  such
Bank  as  Term  SOFR  Loans  shall  be  made,  maintained  or  converted  instead  as  Base  Rate
Loans  (on  which  interest  and  principal  shall  be  payable  contemporaneously  with  the
related Term SOFR Loans of the other Banks), and

47

(y)    after each of its Term SOFR Loans has been repaid or converted, all payments
of  principal  which  would  otherwise  be  applied  to  repay  such  Term  SOFR  Loans  shall  be
applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

give  notice  to  each  Bank  of  the  URL  for  the  Posting  Website  in  writing  by  mail  or  facsimile

The  Platform.  THE  PLATFORM  IS  PROVIDED  “AS  IS”  AND  “AS  AVAILABLE.”  THE  AGENT
PARTIES  (AS  DEFINED  BELOW)  DO  NOT  WARRANT  THE  ACCURACY  OR  COMPLETENESS  OF  THE
BORROWER  MATERIALS  OR  THE  ADEQUACY  OF  THE  PLATFORM,  AND  EXPRESSLY  DISCLAIM
LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,

Parties”)  have  any  liability  to  the  Borrower,  any  Bank,  or  any  other  Person  for  losses,  claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out
of  the  Borrower’s  or  the  Agent’s  transmission  of  Borrower  Materials  or  notices  through  the
Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet
other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Agent Party, as determined by a ﬁnal nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Section 9.02    No Waivers; Enforcement. No failure or delay by the Agent or any Bank in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver
thereof  nor  shall  any  single  or  partial  exercise  thereof  preclude  any  other  or  further  exercise
thereof  or  the  exercise  of  any  other  right,  power  or  privilege.  The  rights  and  remedies  herein
provided  shall  be  cumulative  and  not  exclusive  of  any  rights  or  remedies  provided  by  law.
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein  or  in  any  other  document,
instrument or agreements evidencing, securing or relating to this Agreement (together with this
Agreement, collectively, the “Loan Documents”), the authority to enforce rights and remedies
hereunder  and  under  the  other  Loan  Documents  against  the  Borrower  shall  be  vested
exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall
be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Agent in accordance with Section 6.02 for the
beneﬁt  of  all  the  Banks;  provided,  however,  that  the  foregoing  shall  not  prohibit  (a)  the  Agent
from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its beneﬁt (solely in its
capacity  as  Agent)  hereunder  and  under  the  other  Loan  Documents,  (b)  any  Bank  from
exercising  setoﬀ  rights  in  accordance  with  Section  9.04,  or  (c)  any  Bank  from  ﬁling  proofs  of
claim or appearing and ﬁling pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding relative to the Borrower.

Section 9.03    Expenses; Indemniﬁcation.

(a)        The  Borrower  shall  pay  (i)  all  reasonable  and  documented  out-of-pocket
expenses of the Agent, including reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of
special  counsel  for  the  Agent,  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  this  Agreement,  any
waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default
hereunder  and  (ii)  if  an  Event  of  Default  occurs,  all  reasonable  and  documented  out-of-
pocket  expenses  incurred  by  the  Agent  and  each  Bank,  including  reasonable  and
documented fees and disbursements of counsel, in connection with such Event of Default
and  collection,  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  and  other  enforcement  proceedings  resulting
therefrom.

(b)    The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Bank, their respective
aﬃliates  and  the  respective  directors,  oﬃcers,  agents,  attorneys  and  employees  of  the
foregoing  (each  an  “Indemnitee”)  and  hold  each  Indemnitee  harmless  from  and  against
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without
limitation,  the  reasonable  fees  and  disbursements  of  counsel,  which  may  be  incurred  by
such 
judicial
proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) relating
to  or  arising  out  of  this  Agreement  or  any  actual  or  proposed  use  of  proceeds  of  Loans
hereunder (the “Indemniﬁed Liabilities”); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities

investigative,  administrative  or 

in  connection  with  any 

Indemnitee 

49

or  related  expenses  (x)  are  determined  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  by  ﬁnal  and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnitee, (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnitee
for  breach  in  bad  faith  of  such  Indemnitee’s  obligations  hereunder  or  under  any  other
Loan  Document,  if  the  Borrower  has  obtained  a  ﬁnal  and  nonappealable  judgment  in  its
favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (z) relate to any
claim not involving an act or omission of the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or aﬃliates
brought by an Indemnitee against another Indemnitee (other than against the Agent in its
capacity  as  such),  and  further  provided  that  no  Indemnitee  shall  be  indemniﬁed  for  any
U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any
damages  arising  from  the  use  by  others  of  information  or  other  materials  obtained
through  internet,  Posting  Website  or  other  similarly  available  electronic  media  in
connection  with  the  electronic  posting  of  ﬁnancial  statements,  certiﬁcates,  reports  or
other information to a Posting Website as provided for in Section 9.01 hereof unless such
Indemnitee has engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(c)    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Borrower shall not assert,
and  hereby  waives,  any  claim  against  any  Indemnitee,  on  any  theory  of  liability,  for
special,  indirect,  consequential  or  punitive  damages  (as  opposed  to  direct  or  actual
damages)  arising  out  of,  in  connection  with,  or  as  a  result  of,  this  Agreement,  any  other
Loan  Document  or  any  agreement  or  instrument  contemplated  hereby,  the  transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

Section 9.04    Sharing of Set-Oﬀ. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right
of  set-oﬀ,  recoupment,  counterclaim  or  otherwise,  receive  payment  of  a  proportion  of  the
aggregate amount of principal and interest then due with respect to any Loans held by it which
is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of
principal  and  interest  then  due  with  respect  to  any  Loans  held  by  such  other  Bank,  the  Bank
receiving  such  proportionately  greater  payment  (the  “Beneﬁted  Bank”)  shall  purchase  such
participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made,
as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans
held  by  the  Banks  shall  be  shared  by  the  Banks  pro  rata;  provided,  however,  that  if  all  or  any
portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such Beneﬁted Bank or is repaid in
whole  or  in  part  by  such  Beneﬁted  Bank  in  good  faith  settlement  of  a  pending  or  threatened
avoidance  claim,  such  purchase  shall  be  rescinded,  and  the  purchase  price  and  beneﬁts
returned,  to  the  extent  of  such  recovery  or  settlement  payment,  but  without  interest;  further
provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of
set-oﬀ  or  counterclaim  it  may  have  and  to  apply  the  amount  subject  to  such  exercise  to  the
payment  of  indebtedness  of  the  Borrower  other  than  its  indebtedness  under  this  Agreement.
The  Borrower  agrees,  to  the  fullest  extent  it  may  eﬀectively  do  so  under  applicable  Law,  that
any  holder  of  a  participation  in  a  Loan,  whether  or  not  acquired  pursuant  to  the  foregoing
arrangements,  may  exercise  rights  of  set-oﬀ  or  counterclaim  and  other  rights  with  respect  to
such  participation  as  fully  as  if  such  holder  of  a  participation  were  a  direct  creditor  of  the
Borrower in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
any  Defaulting  Bank  shall  exercise  any  such  right  of  setoﬀ,  recoupment,  counterclaim  or
otherwise,  (x)  all  amounts  so  set  oﬀ  shall  be  paid  over  immediately  to  the  Agent  for  further
application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, shall
be segregated by such Defaulting Bank from its other funds and

50

deemed  held  in  trust  for  the  beneﬁt  of  the  Agent  and  the  Banks,  and  (y)  the  Defaulting  Bank
shall provide promptly to the Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations
under  this  Agreement  owing  to  such  Defaulting  Bank  as  to  which  it  exercised  such  right  of
setoﬀ, recoupment, counterclaim or otherwise.

Section 9.05    Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement or the Notes, if
any, may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed  by  the  Borrower  and  the  Required  Banks  (and,  if  the  rights  or  duties  of  the  Agent  are
aﬀected thereby, by the Agent); provided that no such amendment or waiver shall: (a) increase,
decrease  or  extend  the  Commitment  of  any  Bank  (except  for  (i)  a  ratable  decrease  in  the
Commitments  of  all  Banks,  (ii)  any  increase  in  Commitments  made  pursuant  to,  and  in
compliance  with,  Sections  2.16  and  2.17,  as  applicable,  and  (iii)  any  extension  made  pursuant
to,  and  in  compliance  with,  Section  2.17)  or  subject  any  Bank  to  any  additional  obligation,
without the written consent of such Bank; (b) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any
Loan  or  any  fees  or  margins  hereunder  (subject  to  the  second  proviso  to  this  Section  9.05),
without the written consent of each Bank directly aﬀected thereby (provided, however, that only
the consent of the Required Banks shall be necessary (i) to amend the rate payable as default
interest  hereunder  or  to  waive  any  obligation  of  the  Borrower  to  pay  interest  at  such  default
rate, or (ii) to amend Section 5.07 or 5.08 (or any deﬁned term used therein) even if the eﬀect
of  such  amendment  would  be  to  reduce  the  rate  of  interest  on  any  Loan  or  to  reduce  any  fee
payable  hereunder);  (c)  postpone  the  date  ﬁxed  for  any  payment  of  principal  of  or  interest  on
any  Loan  or  any  fees  hereunder  or  for  the  Termination  Date  (except  pursuant  to  and  in
compliance with Section 2.17 hereof), without the written consent of each Bank directly aﬀected
thereby;  (d)  change  the  percentage  of  the  Commitments  or  of  the  aggregate  unpaid  principal
amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of
them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement, without the
written consent of each Bank; (e) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the written consent of each Bank; or (f)
amend,  modify  or  waive  Section  6.03,  Section  9.04  or  this  Section  9.05  without  the  written
consent  of  each  Bank;  provided  further,  however,  that  the  Fee  Letter  and  any  other  fee  letter
relating  hereto  may  be  amended,  or  rights  or  privileges  thereunder  waived,  in  a  writing
executed  only  by  the  parties  thereto.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  no
Defaulting  Bank  shall  have  any  right  to  approve  or  disapprove  any  amendment,  waiver  or
consent  hereunder  (and  any  amendment,  waiver  or  consent  which  by  its  terms  requires  the
consent of all Banks or each aﬀected Bank may be eﬀected with the consent of the applicable
Banks  other  than  Defaulting  Banks),  except  that  (x)  the  Commitment  of  any  Defaulting  Bank
may not be increased or extended nor principal amounts owing to such Defaulting Bank forgiven
or reduced, or the ﬁnal maturity thereof extended without the consent of such Bank, and (y) any
waiver,  amendment  or  modiﬁcation  requiring  the  consent  of  all  Banks  or  each  aﬀected  Bank
that  by  its  terms  aﬀects  any  Defaulting  Bank  disproportionately  adversely  relative  to  other
aﬀected Banks shall require the consent of such Defaulting Bank.

Section 9.06    Successors and Assigns.

(a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the beneﬁt
of  the  parties  hereto  and  their  respective  successors  and  assigns  permitted  hereby,
except  that  the  Borrower  may  not  assign  or  otherwise  transfer  any  of  its  rights  or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Agent and each Bank, and

51

no Bank may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except
(i)  to  an  Assignee  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  and  (d)  of  this
Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of
this  Section,  or  (iii)  by  way  of  pledge  or  assignment  of  a  security  interest  subject  to  the
restrictions of subsection (e) or (g) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed
or  implied,  shall  be  construed  to  confer  upon  any  Person  (other  than  the  parties  hereto,
their  respective  successors  and  assigns  permitted  hereby,  Participants  to  the  extent
provided  in  subsection  (b)  of  this  Section  and,  to  the  extent  expressly  contemplated
hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason
of this Agreement.

(b)        Any  Bank  may  at  any  time  grant  to  one  or  more  banks,  Approved  Funds  or
other  institutions  (other  than  a  Defaulting  Bank  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,  or  any  Person
who,  upon  becoming  a  Bank  hereunder,  would  constitute  a  Defaulting  Bank)  (each  a
“Participant”) participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the
event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or
not upon notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the
performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue
to  deal  solely  and  directly  with  such  Bank  in  connection  with  such  Bank’s  rights  and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant
such  a  participating  interest  shall  provide  that  such  Bank  shall  retain  the  sole  right  and
responsibility  to  enforce  the  obligations  of  the  Borrower  hereunder  including,  without
limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modiﬁcation or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank
will  not  agree  to  any  modiﬁcation,  amendment  or  waiver  of  this  Agreement  described  in
clause (a), (b) or (c) of Section 9.05 without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower
agrees  that  each  Participant  shall,  to  the  extent  provided  in  its  participation  agreement,
be  entitled  to  the  beneﬁts  of  Article  8  and  Section  2.14  with  respect  to  its  participating
interest  to  the  same  extent  as  if  it  were  a  Bank  (and  it  being  understood  that  the
documentation  required  under  Section  2.14  shall  be  required  to  be  delivered  to  the
participating  Bank);  provided  that  such  Participant  shall  not  be  entitled  to  receive  any
greater  payment  under  Section  2.14,  with  respect  to  any  participation,  than  its
participating  Bank  would  have  been  entitled  to  receive,  except  to  the  extent  such
entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after
the  Participant  acquired  the  applicable  participation.  An  assignment  or  other  transfer
which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given eﬀect for purposes of
this  Agreement  only  to  the  extent  of  a  participating  interest  granted  in  accordance  with
this subsection (b). Each Bank that sells a participating interest shall, acting solely for this
purpose  as  a  non-ﬁduciary  agent  of  the  Borrower,  maintain  a  register  on  which  it  enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest)
of  each  Participant’s  interest  in  the  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (the  “Participant
Register”); provided that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of
the  Participant  Register  (including  the  identity  of  any  Participant  or  any  information
relating  to  a  Participant’s  interest  in  any  commitments,  loans  or  its  other  obligations
hereunder)  to  any  Person  except  to  the  extent  that  such  disclosure  is  necessary  to
establish  that  such  commitment,  loan  or  other  obligation  is  in  registered  form  under
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

52

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such
Bank  shall  treat  each  Person  whose  name  is  recorded  in  the  Participant  Register  as  the
owner  of  such  participating  interest  for  all  purposes  of  this  Agreement  notwithstanding
any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent)
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(c)        Any  Bank  may  at  any  time  assign  to  one  or  more  banks,  Approved  Funds  or
other  institutions  (other  a  Defaulting  Bank  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,  or  any  Person  who,
upon  becoming  a  Bank  hereunder,  would  constitute  a  Defaulting  Bank)  (each  an
“Assignee”)  all,  or  a  proportionate  part  of  all,  of  its  rights  and  obligations  under  this
Agreement  and  its  Notes,  if  any,  and  such  Assignee  shall  assume  such  rights  and
obligations,  pursuant  to  an  Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreement  in  substantially  the
form of Exhibit F hereto (an “Assignment and Assumption Agreement”) executed by
such  Assignee  and  such  transferor  Bank,  with  and  subject  to  the  subscribed  consents  of
the  Agent  and  (so  long  as  an  Event  of  Default  has  not  occurred  and  is  continuing)  the
Borrower,  which  consents  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed;  provided  that
the  Borrower  shall  be  deemed  to  have  consented  to  any  such  assignment  unless  it  shall
object  thereto  by  written  notice  to  the  Agent  within  ﬁve  (5)  Business  Days  after  having
received  notice  thereof;  provided  further  that  no  interest  may  be  assigned  by  a  Bank
pursuant to this subsection (c) in an amount less than $15,000,000 unless (A) such lesser
amount  constitutes  all  of  such  assigning  Bank’s  Commitment,  or  (B)  the  Agent  and  (so
long  as  an  Event  of  Default  has  not  occurred  and  is  continuing)  the  Borrower,  in  its  sole
discretion,  otherwise  consent  to  a  lesser  amount.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  an
Assignee  is  an  aﬃliate  of  a  Bank  or  a  Bank,  (x)  the  subscribed  consents  of  the  Borrower
and  the  Agent  shall  not  be  required  and  (y)  the  limitations  set  forth  above  shall  not  be
applicable. In all cases, any assignment to any Approved Fund requires the consent of the
Borrower,  which  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed;  provided  that  the
Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object
thereto by written notice to the Agent within ﬁve (5) Business Days after having received
notice  thereof.  Upon  execution  and  delivery  of  such  instrument  and  payment  by  such
Assignee  to  such  transferor  Bank  of  an  amount  equal  to  the  purchase  price  agreed
between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to
this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment
as  set  forth  in  such  instrument  of  assumption,  and  the  transferor  Bank  shall  be  released
from  its  obligations  hereunder  to  a  corresponding  extent  (and,  in  the  case  of  an
assignment  covering  all  of  the  assigning  Bank’s  rights  and  obligations  under  this
Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto) and no further consent or action
by any party shall be required, but the transferor Bank shall continue to be entitled to the
beneﬁts  of  Article  8  with  respect  to  facts  and  circumstances  occurring  prior  to  the
eﬀective  date  of  such  assignment.  Upon  the  consummation  of  any  assignment  pursuant
to  this  subsection  (c),  the  transferor  Bank,  the  Agent  and  the  Borrower  shall  make
appropriate  arrangements  so  that,  if  required,  a  new  Note  is  issued  to  the  Assignee.
Except  as  otherwise  provided  herein,  in  connection  with  any  such  assignment,  the
transferor  Bank  shall  pay  to  the  Agent  an  administrative  fee  for  processing  such
assignment in the amount of $3,500, unless waived by the Agent in its sole discretion. If
the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state
thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certiﬁcation as to

53

exemption  from  deduction  or  withholding  of  any  United  States  federal  income  taxes  in
accordance with Section 2.14.

The  Agent,  acting  solely  for  this  purpose  as  an  Agent  of  the  Borrower  (and  such  agency
being  solely  for  tax  purposes),  shall  maintain  at  the  Agent’s  principal  oﬃce  a  copy  of  each
Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
names  and  addresses  of  the  Banks,  and  the  Commitments  of,  and  principal  amounts  of  the
Loans  owing  to,  each  Bank  pursuant  to  the  terms  hereof  from  time  to  time  (the  “Register”).
The  entries  in  the  Register  as  to  the  identity  of  the  Banks  and  their  respective  Commitments
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks may treat
each  Person  whose  name  is  recorded  in  the  Register  pursuant  to  the  terms  hereof  as  a  Bank
hereunder  for  all  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  notwithstanding  notice  to  the  contrary.  In
addition,  the  Agent  shall  maintain  on  the  Register  information  regarding  the  designation,  and
revocation of designation, of any Bank as a Defaulting Bank. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable  prior  notice.  In  addition,  at  any  time  that  a  request  for  a  consent  for  a  material  or
substantive change to this Agreement is pending, any Bank wishing to consult with other Banks
in connection therewith may request and receive from the Agent a copy of the Register.

(d)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting
Bank hereunder, no such assignment shall be eﬀective unless and until, in addition to the
other  conditions  thereto  set  forth  herein,  the  parties  to  the  assignment  shall  make  such
additional  payments  to  the  Agent  in  an  aggregate  amount  suﬃcient,  upon  distribution
thereof  as  appropriate  (which  may  be  outright  payment,  purchases  by  the  assignee  of
participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with
the  consent  of  the  Borrower  and  the  Agent,  the  applicable  pro  rata  share  of  Loans
previously  requested  but  not  funded  by  the  Defaulting  Bank,  to  each  of  which  the
applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full
all  payment  liabilities  then  owed  by  such  Defaulting  Bank  to  the  Agent  or  any  Bank
hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full
pro  rata  share  of  all  Loans  in  proportion  to  its  Commitment.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  in  the  event  that  any  assignment  of  rights  and  obligations  of  any  Defaulting
Bank hereunder shall become eﬀective under applicable Law without compliance with the
provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a
Defaulting Bank for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

(e)        Any  Bank  may  at  any  time  assign  all  or  any  portion  of  its  rights  under  this
Agreement  and  its  Note,  if  any,  to  a  Federal  Reserve  Bank.  No  such  assignment  shall
release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

(f)        No  Assignee,  Participant  or  other  transferee  of  any  Bank’s  rights  shall  be
entitled  to  receive  any  greater  payment  under  Section  8.03  than  such  Bank  would  have
been  entitled  to  receive  with  respect  to  the  rights  transferred,  unless  such  transfer  is
made with the Borrower’s prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section
8.02  or  8.03  requiring  such  Bank  to  designate  a  diﬀerent  Lending  Oﬃce  under  certain
circumstances  or  at  a  time  when  the  circumstances  giving  rise  to  such  greater  payment
did not exist.

54

(g)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank that is an
Approved Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it
and  the  Note,  if  any,  held  by  it  to  the  trustee  for  the  holders  of  obligations  owed,  or
securities  issued,  by  such  Approved  Fund  as  security  for  such  obligations  or  securities,
provided  that  unless  and  until  such  trustee  actually  becomes  a  Bank  in  compliance  with
the other provisions of Section 9.06(c), (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Bank
from any of its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled
to exercise any of the rights of a Bank under this Agreement, including but not limited to
rights  to  approve  amendments,  waivers  or  other  modiﬁcations  of  any  provision  of  this
Agreement, even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to
the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

(h)    No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s
aﬃliates  or  Subsidiaries,  (B)  to  any  Defaulting  Bank  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,  or  any
Person  who,  upon  becoming  a  Bank  hereunder,  would  constitute  any  of  the  foregoing
Persons  described  in  this  clause  (B),  or  (C)  to  a  natural  Person  (or  a  holding  company
investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary beneﬁt of a natural
Person).

Section 9.07    Collateral. Each of the Banks represents to the Agent and each of the other
Banks that it in good faith is not relying upon any “margin stock” (as deﬁned in Regulation U) as
collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

Section  9.08        Replacement  of  Banks.  (a)  If  any  Bank  requests  compensation  under
Section  8.03,  or  if  the  obligation  of  any  Bank  to  make  Term  SOFR  Loans  has  been  suspended
pursuant to Section 8.02, or if any Bank is a Defaulting Bank, or if any Bank is a Non-Extending
Bank for any extension of the Termination Date, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and
eﬀort,  upon  notice  to  such  Bank  and  the  Agent,  require  such  Bank  to  assign  and  delegate
without unreasonable delay, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations
under  this  Agreement  to  an  assignee  that  shall  assume  such  obligations  (which  assignee  may
be another Bank, if a Bank accepts such assignment), provided that:

(i)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee speciﬁed in
Section 9.06(c) (except as otherwise provided herein); provided that any Defaulting
Bank shall pay to the Agent the assignment fee speciﬁed in Section 9.06(c);

(ii)        such  Bank  shall  have  received  payment  of  an  amount  equal  to  the
outstanding  principal  of  its  Loans,  accrued  interest  thereon,  accrued  fees  and  all
other amounts payable to it hereunder (including any amounts under Section 2.13)
from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest
and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

(iii)        in  the  case  of  any  such  assignment  resulting  from  a  claim  for

compensation by a Bank under Section 8.03, such assignment will result in a

55

reduction in such compensation or payments that would otherwise result thereafter;
and

(iv)    such assignment does not conﬂict with applicable Laws.

A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto,
as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

(b)        In  the  event  any  Bank  fails  to  approve  any  amendment,  waiver  or  consent
requested  by  the  Borrower  pursuant  to  Section  9.05  that  has  received  the  written
approval of not less than the Required Banks but also requires the approval of such Bank
(any  such  Bank,  a  “Restricted  Bank”),  so  long  as  no  Default  or  Event  of  Default  shall
have  occurred  and  be  continuing  and  the  Borrower  has  obtained  a  commitment  (in  an
amount not less than the entire amount of such Restricted Bank’s Commitment) from one
or more Banks or Assignees to become a Bank for all purposes hereunder (such Bank or
Banks referred to as the “Replacement Bank”), the Borrower may cause such Restricted
Bank to be replaced by, and to assign all its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including  its  Commitment  and  its  outstanding  Loans)  pursuant  to  Section  9.06  to,  such
Replacement  Bank.  Such  Restricted  Bank  agrees  to  execute  and  to  deliver  to  the  Agent
one  or  more  Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreements  with  such  Replacement  Bank  as
provided  in  Section  9.06  upon  payment  at  par  of  all  principal,  accrued  interest,  accrued
fees and other amounts accrued or owing under this Agreement to such Restricted Bank,
and  such  Replacement  Bank  shall  pay  to  the  Agent  the  assignment  fee  speciﬁed  in
Section  9.06(c)  in  connection  with  such  assignment.  The  Restricted  Bank  making  such
assignment  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  any  expenses  or  other  amounts  which
would be owing to such Restricted Bank pursuant to any indemniﬁcation provision hereof
(including,  if  applicable,  Section  2.12)  as  if  the  Borrower  had  prepaid  the  Loans  of  such
Bank  (and  terminated  its  Commitment,  if  applicable)  rather  than  such  Restricted  Bank
having assigned its interest hereunder.

(c)    In each case of clause (a) and (b) above, the Agent shall distribute an amended
schedule  of  Commitments,  which  shall  be  deemed  incorporated  into  this  Agreement,  to
reﬂect  changes  in  the  identities  of  the  Banks  and  adjustments  of  their  respective
Commitments and/or shares thereof resulting from any such replacement.

(d)    This section shall supersede any provision in Section 9.05 to the contrary.

Section 9.09    Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a)        This  Agreement  and  each  Note  shall  be  governed  by  and  construed  in
accordance  with  the  laws  of  the  State  of  New  York.  The  Borrower  hereby  submits  to  the
nonexclusive  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of
New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.  The  Borrower  irrevocably  waives,  to  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law,  any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any

56

such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought
in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

(b)    EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED  BY  APPLICABLE  LAW,  ANY  RIGHT  IT  MAY  HAVE  TO  A  TRIAL  BY  JURY  IN  ANY
LEGAL  PROCEEDING  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY  ARISING  OUT  OF  OR  RELATING  TO  THIS
AGREEMENT  OR  ANY  OTHER  LOAN  DOCUMENT  OR  THE  TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY  OR  THEREBY  (WHETHER  BASED  ON  CONTRACT,  TORT  OR  ANY  OTHER  THEORY). 
EACH  PARTY  HERETO  (A)  CERTIFIES  THAT  NO  REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT  OR  ATTORNEY  OF
ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED  TO  ENTER  INTO  THIS  AGREEMENT  AND  THE  OTHER  LOAN  DOCUMENTS  BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 9.10    Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same eﬀect as if the signatures thereto
and  hereto  were  upon  the  same  instrument.  This  Agreement  constitutes  the  entire  agreement
and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

Section 9.11    Conﬁdentiality. Each Bank agrees to exercise all reasonable eﬀorts to keep
any Information delivered or made available by the Borrower to it which is clearly indicated to
be conﬁdential information, conﬁdential from anyone other than Persons employed or retained
by such Bank who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring
or administering the Loans; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Bank from disclosing
such  Information  (a)  to  any  of  its  aﬃliates  or  any  other  Bank  or  aﬃliate  thereof,  (b)  to  its
oﬃcers,  directors,  employees,  agents,  attorneys  and  accountants  who  have  a  need  to  know
such  Information  in  accordance  with  customary  banking  practices  and  who  receive  such
Information  having  been  made  aware  of  the  restrictions  set  forth  in  this  Section,  (c)  upon  the
order of any court or administrative agency, (d) upon the request or demand of any regulatory
agency  or  authority  having  jurisdiction  over  such  Bank  or  its  aﬃliates,  (e)  as  required  by  any
applicable  Law,  rule  or  regulation,  (f)  to  any  other  Person  if  reasonably  necessary  to  the
administration of the credit facility provided herein, (g) which has been publicly disclosed, (h) to
the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which the Agent, any Bank,
the Borrower or their respective aﬃliates may be a party, (i) to the extent reasonably required in
connection  with  the  exercise  of  any  remedy  hereunder,  (j)  to  such  Bank’s  legal  counsel  and
independent  auditors,  (k)  with  the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Borrower,  (l)  subject  to  an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 9.11 (i) to any
actual  or  proposed  Participant  or  Assignee  of  all  or  part  of  its  rights  hereunder,  or  (ii)  to  any
actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction
under  which  payments  are  to  be  made  by  reference  to  the  Borrower  and  its  obligations,  this
Agreement  or  payments  hereunder,  (m)  on  a  conﬁdential  basis  to  (i)  any  rating  agency  in
connection with rating the Borrower or the credit facility provided hereunder, or (ii) the provider
of any Platform or other electronic delivery service used by the

57

Agent,  to  deliver  Borrower  Materials  or  notice  to  the  Banks  or  (n)  the  CUSIP  Service  Bureau  or
any  similar  agency  in  connection  with  the  application,  issuance,  publishing  and  monitoring
CUSIP numbers or other market identiﬁers in respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder.
For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower
relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective business, other than
any such information that is available to the Agent or any Bank on a nonconﬁdential basis prior
to  disclosure  by  the  Borrower,  provided  that,  in  the  case  of  information  received  from  the
Borrower  after  the  date  hereof,  such  information  is  clearly  identiﬁed  at  the  time  of  delivery  as
conﬁdential.

Section  9.12        No  Advisory  or  Fiduciary  Responsibility.  In  connection  with  all  aspects  of
each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or
other  modiﬁcation  hereof  or  of  any  other  Loan  Document),  the  Borrower  acknowledges  and
agrees,  and  acknowledges  its  Aﬃliates’  understanding,  that:  (i)  (A)  the  arranging  and  other
services  regarding  this  Agreement  provided  by  the  Agent,  the  Arrangers  and  the  Banks  are
arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its aﬃliates, on the one hand,
and the Agent, the Arrangers and the Banks, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted
its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate,
and  (C)  the  Borrower  is  capable  of  evaluating,  and  understands  and  accepts,  the  terms,  risks
and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii)
(A) each of the Agent, the Arrangers and the Banks is and has been acting solely as a principal
and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will
not  be  acting  as  an  advisor,  agent  or  ﬁduciary  for  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  aﬃliates,  or  any
other  Person  and  (B)  neither  the  Agent,  any  Arranger  nor  any  Bank  has  any  obligation  to  the
Borrower  or  any  of  its  aﬃliates  with  respect  to  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  except
those  obligations  expressly  set  forth  herein  and  in  the  other  Loan  Documents;  and  (iii)  the
Agent, the Arrangers, the Banks and their respective aﬃliates may be engaged in a broad range
of transactions that involve interests that diﬀer from those of the Borrower and its aﬃliates, and
neither  the  Agent  nor  any  Arranger  nor  any  Bank  has  any  obligation  to  disclose  any  of  such
interests to the Borrower or any of its aﬃliates.

Section  9.13        Electronic  Execution;  Electronic  Records;  Counterparts.  This  Agreement,
any Loan Document and any other Communication, including Communications required to be in
writing,  may  be  in  the  form  of  an  Electronic  Record  and  may  be  executed  using  Electronic
Signatures.  Each  of  the  parties  hereto  and  each  of  the  Agent  and  each  Bank  agrees  that  any
Electronic  Signature  on  or  associated  with  any  Communication  shall  be  valid  and  binding  on
such  Person  to  the  same  extent  as  a  manual,  original  signature,  and  that  any  Communication
entered  into  by  Electronic  Signature,  will  constitute  the  legal,  valid  and  binding  obligation  of
such Person enforceable against such Person in accordance with the terms thereof to the same
extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered. Any Communication may be
executed  in  as  many  counterparts  as  necessary  or  convenient,  including  both  paper  and
electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the
avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include, without limitation, use
or  acceptance  of  a  manually  signed  paper  Communication  which  has  been  converted  into
electronic  form  (such  as  scanned  into  PDF  format),  or  an  electronically  signed  Communication
converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Agent and each
of the Banks may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of
an imaged Electronic Record (“Electronic Copy”), which shall be deemed created in the ordinary
course of such Person’s business, and destroy the original paper document. All Communications
in the form of an

58

Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes,
and  shall  have  the  same  legal  eﬀect,  validity  and  enforceability  as  a  paper  record.
Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein  to  the  contrary,  the  Agent  is  not  under  any
obligation  to  accept  an  Electronic  Signature  in  any  form  or  in  any  format  unless  expressly
agreed  to  by  such  Person  pursuant  to  procedures  approved  by  it;  provided,  further,  without
limiting  the  foregoing,  (a)  to  the  extent  the  Agent  has  agreed  to  accept  such  Electronic
Signature,  the  Agent  and  each  of  the  Banks  shall  be  entitled  to  rely  on  any  such  Electronic
Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of any party hereto and/or any Bank without further
veriﬁcation and (b) upon the request of the Agent or any Bank, any Electronic Signature shall be
promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.

The  Agent  shall  not  be  responsible  for  or  have  any  duty  to  ascertain  or  inquire  into  the
suﬃciency,  validity,  enforceability,  eﬀectiveness  or  genuineness  of  any  Loan  Document  or  any
other agreement, instrument or document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with  the  Agent’s  reliance  on  any  Electronic  Signature  transmitted  by  telecopy,  emailed  .pdf  or
any  other  electronic  means).  The  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  rely  on,  and  shall  incur  no  liability
under  or  in  respect  of  this  Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document  by  acting  upon,  any
Communication  (which  writing  may  be  a  fax,  any  electronic  message,  Internet  or  intranet
website posting or other distribution or signed using an Electronic Signature) or any statement
made  to  it  orally  or  by  telephone  and  believed  by  it  to  be  genuine  and  signed  or  sent  or
otherwise authenticated (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in
the Loan Documents for being the maker thereof).

Section  9.14        USA  PATRIOT  Act  Notice.  Each  Bank  that  is  subject  to  the  Act  (as
hereinafter deﬁned) and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Bank) hereby notiﬁes the
Borrower  that  pursuant  to  the  requirements  of  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act  (Title  III  of  Pub.  L.  107-56
(signed  into  law  October  26,  2001))  (the  “Act”),  it  is  required  to  obtain,  verify  and  record
information  that  identiﬁes  the  Borrower,  which  information  includes  the  name  and  address  of
the  Borrower  and  other  information  that  will  allow  such  Bank  or  the  Agent,  as  applicable,  to
identify  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  Act.  The  Borrower  shall,  promptly  following  a
request  by  the  Agent  or  any  Bank,  provide  all  documentation  and  other  information  that  the
Agent  or  such  Bank  requests  in  order  to  comply  with  its  ongoing  obligations  under  applicable
“know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Act.

Section 9.15    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Aﬀected Financial Institutions.
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  any  this  Agreement  or  in  any  other  agreement,
arrangement  or  understanding  among  any  such  parties,  each  party  hereto  acknowledges  that
any  liability  of  any  Bank  that  is  an  Aﬀected  Financial  Institution  arising  under  any  this
Agreement,  to  the  extent  such  liability  is  unsecured,  may  be  subject  to  the  Write-Down  and
Conversion  Powers  of  the  applicable  Resolution  Authority  and  agrees  and  consents  to,  and
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a)        the  application  of  any  Write-Down  and  Conversion  Powers  by  the  applicable
Resolution  Authority  to  any  such  liabilities  arising  hereunder  which  may  be  payable  to  it
by any Bank that is an Aﬀected Financial Institution; and

59

(b)    the eﬀects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:

(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;

(ii)        a  conversion  of  all,  or  a  portion  of,  such  liability  into  shares  or  other
instruments  of  ownership 
its  parent
in  such  Aﬀected  Financial 
undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred
on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it
in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement; or

Institution, 

(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise

of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.

Section 9.16    Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that this
Agreement  provide  support,  through  a  guarantee  or  otherwise,  for  any  “swap”  or  hedging
agreement  or  any  other  agreement  or  instrument  that  is  a  QFC  (such  support,  “QFC  Credit
Support”,  and  each  such  QFC,  a  “Supported  QFC”),  the  parties  acknowledge  and  agree  as
follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under
the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Act  and  Title  II  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  and
Consumer  Protection  Act  (together  with  the  regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  the  “U.S.
Special  Resolution  Regimes”)  in  respect  of  such  Supported  QFC  and  QFC  Credit  Support  (with
the  provisions  below  applicable  notwithstanding  that  this  Agreement  and  any  Supported  QFC
may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United
States or any other state of the United States):

(a)        In  the  event  a  Covered  Entity  that  is  party  to  a  Supported  QFC  (each,  a
“Covered  Party”)  becomes  subject  to  a  proceeding  under  a  U.S.  Special  Resolution
Regime,  the  transfer  of  such  Supported  QFC  and  the  beneﬁt  of  such  QFC  Credit  Support
(and  any  interest  and  obligation  in  or  under  such  Supported  QFC  and  such  QFC  Credit
Support,  and  any  rights  in  property  securing  such  Supported  QFC  or  such  QFC  Credit
Support)  from  such  Covered  Party  will  be  eﬀective  to  the  same  extent  as  the  transfer
would  be  eﬀective  under  the  U.S.  Special  Resolution  Regime  if  the  Supported  QFC  and
such  QFC  Credit  Support  (and  any  such  interest,  obligation  and  rights  in  property)  were
governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a
Covered Party or a BHC Act Aﬃliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding
under  a  U.S.  Special  Resolution  Regime,  Default  Rights  under  the  Loan  Documents  that
might  otherwise  apply  to  such  Supported  QFC  or  any  QFC  Credit  Support  that  may  be
exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent
than  such  Default  Rights  could  be  exercised  under  the  U.S.  Special  Resolution  Regime  if
the  Supported  QFC  and  the  Loan  Documents  were  governed  by  the  laws  of  the  United

Re: Second Extension Amendment of Credit Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to that certain Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of October 18, 2021 (as
amended,  restated,  extended,  supplemented  or  otherwise  modiﬁed  from  time  to  time,  the
“Credit Agreement”), among Target Corporation (the “Borrower”), the Banks (as deﬁned therein)
party  thereto  from  time  to  time  and  Bank  of  America,  N.A.,  as  administrative  agent  (the
“Administrative Agent”). Capitalized terms used but not deﬁned herein shall have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement.

Pursuant  to  Section  2.17  of  the  Credit  Agreement,  the  Borrower  hereby  requests  that  the
Termination Date of the Commitments be extended from October 18, 2027 to October 18, 2028.
It is the intent of the Borrower that this request for extension shall constitute notice of a request
for extension pursuant to Section 2.17(a) of the Credit Agreement, and that the date ﬁrst above
written shall constitute the Notice Date.

The Credit Agreement and the Notes are and shall continue to be in full force and eﬀect and are
hereby  in  all  respects  ratiﬁed  and  conﬁrmed.  The  execution,  delivery  and  eﬀectiveness  of  this
extension  amendment  (the  “Extension  Amendment”)  shall  not,  except  as  expressly  provided
herein,  operate  as  a  waiver  of  any  right,  power  or  remedy  of  any  Bank  or  the  Administrative
Agent  under  the  Credit  Agreement,  nor  constitute  a  waiver  of  any  provision  of  the  Credit
Agreement.

If  you  agree  to  the  terms  and  provisions  of  this  Extension  Amendment,  please  evidence  such
agreement  and  indicate  your  response  to  the  request  for  extension  of  the  Termination  Date  by
executing  and  returning  three  original  counterparts  of  this  Extension  Amendment  to  Rebecca
Chaﬃn, Esq., McGuireWoods, LLP, 201 North Tryon Street, Suite 3000, Charlotte, North Carolina
28202 by October 4, 2023. This Extension Amendment shall be eﬀective upon satisfaction of the
requirements of Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement, but in no event prior to October 18, 2023.

This  Extension  Amendment  may  be  executed  in  any  number  of  counterparts  and  by  diﬀerent
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be
an  original  and  all  of  which  taken  together  shall  constitute  one  and  the  same  agreement.
Delivery  of  an  executed  counterpart  of  a  signature  page  to  this  Extension  Amendment  by
telecopy  or  .pdf  shall  be  eﬀective  as  delivery  of  a  manually  executed  counterpart  of  this
Extension Amendment.

This Extension Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York.

I, Brian C. Cornell, certify that:

1.
2.

3.

4.

I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Target Corporation;
Based  on  my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue  statement  of  a  material  fact  or  omit  to
state  a  material  fact  necessary  to  make  the  statements  made,  in  light  of  the  circumstances  under  which
such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
Based  on  my  knowledge,  the  ﬁnancial  statements,  and  other  ﬁnancial  information  included  in  this  report,
fairly  present  in  all  material  respects  the  ﬁnancial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  ﬂows  of  the
registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
The  registrant’s  other  certifying  oﬃcer  and  I  are  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure
controls  and  procedures  (as  deﬁned  in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e))  and  internal  control
over  ﬁnancial  reporting  (as  deﬁned  in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f))  for  the  registrant  and
have:

a. designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures
to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is  made  known  to  us  by  others  within  those  entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b. designed such internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, or caused such internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting  to  be  designed  under  our  supervision,  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
reliability  of  ﬁnancial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  ﬁnancial  statements  for  external  purposes  in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

c. evaluated  the  eﬀectiveness  of  the  registrant’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  presented  in
this  report  our  conclusions  about  the  eﬀectiveness  of  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  as  of
the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

d. disclosed  in  this  report  any  change  in  the  registrant’s  internal  control  over  ﬁnancial  reporting  that
occurred during the registrant’s most recent ﬁscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth ﬁscal quarter in the
case of an annual report) that has materially aﬀected, or is reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, the
registrant’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting; and

5.

The registrant’s other certifying oﬃcer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board
of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a. all signiﬁcant deﬁciencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
ﬁnancial  reporting  which  are  reasonably  likely  to  adversely  aﬀect  the  registrant’s  ability  to  record,
process, summarize and report ﬁnancial information; and

b. any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves  management  or  other  employees  who  have  a

signiﬁcant role in the registrant’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
