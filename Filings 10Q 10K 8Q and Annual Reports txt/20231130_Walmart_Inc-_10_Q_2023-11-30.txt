Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Walmart Inc.

Note 1. Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Walmart" or the
"Company") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and do not contain certain information included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2023 ("ﬁscal 2023"). Therefore, the
interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a ﬁscal year ending January 31 for the
United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a
one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no signiﬁcant intervening events during the month of October
2023 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially aﬀected the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays,
as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the ﬁscal quarter
ending January 31.

Use of Estimates

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles
require management to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
Management's estimates and assumptions also aﬀect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results may diﬀer materially from those estimates.

Supplier Financing Program Obligations

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50):
Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier
ﬁnance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The Company adopted this ASU as of February 1,
2023, other than the roll-forward disclosure requirement which the Company will adopt in ﬁscal 2025.

The Company has supplier ﬁnancing programs with ﬁnancial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the
ﬁnancial institution the stated amount of conﬁrmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers.
Participation in these programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the
arrangement directly with the ﬁnancial institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these
programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due. The payment terms that the Company has with
participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 and 90 days. The Company does not
have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct ﬁnancial relationship with the
ﬁnancial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating ﬁnancial
institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects
to receive early payment from the ﬁnancial institution. The outstanding payment obligations to ﬁnancial institutions
under these programs were $6.1 billion, $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion, as of October 31, 2023, January 31, 2023 and
October 31, 2022, respectively. These obligations are generally classiﬁed as accounts payable within the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is classiﬁed as an operating
activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable
Segment Disclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced
disclosures about signiﬁcant segment expenses. The amendments are eﬀective for ﬁscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within ﬁscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption
is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the ﬁnancial
statements. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.

Note 2. Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share

Basic net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common
shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart
is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive
eﬀect of share-based awards. The Company did not have signiﬁcant share-based awards outstanding that were
anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for
the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 and the nine months ended October 31, 2022. The calculation
of diluted net loss per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended October 31, 2022 does
not include the eﬀect of share-based payment awards as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and would reduce the
net loss per common share, and such awards were not signiﬁcant.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and
diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart:

Amounts reclassiﬁed from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivative instruments are generally recorded
in interest, net, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts for the minimum
pension liability and currency translation are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt

The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper
program. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0
billion as well as its ﬁve-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the
U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, all undrawn.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

•

•

•

Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable;
and

Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to
develop its own assumptions.

The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain immaterial equity method
investments where the Company has elected the fair value option, on a recurring basis within other long-term
assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts of gains and losses included in
earnings from fair value changes for these investments are recognized within other gains and losses in the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of these investments is as follows:

(Amounts in millions)
Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs
Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs

Changes in the fair value of these investments were primarily due to gains and losses resulting from net changes in
the underlying stock prices, along with certain other immaterial investment activity. These changes in fair value
included net losses of $4.2 billion for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, and net losses of
$3.6 billion and $4.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Equity investments
without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or
impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivatives

The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the
Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.
The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant
interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, the notional
amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

(Amounts in millions)
Receive ﬁxed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value
hedges
Receive ﬁxed-rate, pay ﬁxed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash ﬂow
hedges

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities
are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities
resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of October 31, 2023 in the Company's Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Fair Value Disclosures

The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying
values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.

The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on
the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value
and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, are as follows:

Note 6. Contingencies

Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a
liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is
reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into
discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes
settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.

Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company,
individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's ﬁnancial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows.

Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation

During ﬁscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework
(described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. The Settlement Framework
includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has
substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation. As of October 31, 2023, substantially all of the
original approximately $3.3 billion accrued liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements has been
paid.

In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits ﬁled
against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiﬀs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native
American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of
widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate
Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The
Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL.

On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to ﬁnancial amounts and payment terms to resolve
substantially all opioids-related lawsuits ﬁled against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native
American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below)
or in state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political
subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $3.1 billion (the "Settlement Amount"). The
Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also
includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement
framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political
subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies
for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the "Settlement
Framework."

The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political
subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and
political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or
otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company
announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with
the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories (the "Settling
States"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. On August 22, 2023, the
settlement administrator determined that a suﬃcient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in
the Settlement Framework, which was a necessary condition for the Settlement Framework to become eﬀective.
The Settlement Framework became eﬀective 15 days later, on September 6, 2023. The Company deposited the full
portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States on October 11, 2023. Although the settlement
administrator has determined that suﬃcient number of political subdivisions have agreed to participate in the
Settlement Framework, and thus the Settlement Framework was eﬀective, eligible political subdivisions still have
until July 15, 2025, to join the Settlement Framework.

Other Opioid-Related Litigation

The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise
resolved by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any
other actions ﬁled by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers; and any action ﬁled by a political
subdivision or Native American tribe that is not resolved by the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company
has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any
loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope
and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, ﬁnancial position, results of operations or
cash ﬂows will not be materially adversely aﬀected.

Two-County Trial and MDL Bellwethers; Canada; and Other Litigation. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial
in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, ﬁnding in favor of the plaintiﬀs as to the
liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a
judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate
amount of approximately $0.7 billion over ﬁfteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the
plaintiﬀs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company ﬁled an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment
went into eﬀect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order of
certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio.

The MDL designated ﬁve additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however,
these ﬁve counties have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement
Amount rather than go to trial. On October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by third-party payers
as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other
healthcare providers may be designated in the future.

Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in two
putative class action complaints ﬁled in Canada related to dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.
These matters remain pending.

Similar cases that name the Company also have been ﬁled in state and federal courts by state, local, and tribal
governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiﬀs. Plaintiﬀs in these cases and in the MDL are seeking
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been
responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to
nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.

DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") ﬁled a civil complaint
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled
substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The
complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil
penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021.
After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ ﬁled an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022,
the Company ﬁled a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.

Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two
securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with
respect to opioids, ﬁled in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5,
2021, purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through
December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants ﬁled a motion to
dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9,
2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiﬀs to ﬁle an amended complaint, which was ﬁled on October
14, 2022, and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from
March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants ﬁled a motion to dismiss the
amended complaint. That motion remains pending.

Derivative actions were also ﬁled by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021, alleging breach of ﬁduciary duties against certain of its current
and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also
alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current
oﬃcers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending
developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders ﬁled a derivative
action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the Board of Directors and certain
former oﬃcers breached their ﬁduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids
business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiﬀs
responded by ﬁling an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to
dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26,
2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the
Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay
the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") appointed an independent Special
Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former oﬃcers and
directors named in the various derivative proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has
authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in
carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC
completes its investigation.

Other Legal Proceedings

Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal
value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United
Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the
United Kingdom (the "Asda Equal Value Claims"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the
divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these
claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide
indemniﬁcation with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company
cannot predict the number of such claims that may be ﬁled, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of
loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the
scope and outcome of these matters.

Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United
States Attorney's Oﬃce for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding
the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the
Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August
2020. Walmart's responses to DOJ's subpoenas have been complete since 2021. The Company continues to
cooperate with and provide information and documents voluntarily in response to supplemental requests from the
DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the

15

Table of Contents

United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money
transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC ﬁled a
complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart
violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent
services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company ﬁled a motion
to dismiss the complaint. On March 27, 2023, the Court issued an opinion dismissing the FTC's claim under the
Telemarketing Sales Rule and denying Walmart's motion to dismiss the claim under Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act. On April 12, 2023, Walmart ﬁled a motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for
interlocutory appeal. On June 30, 2023, the FTC ﬁled an amended complaint against Walmart again asserting claims
under the Federal Trade Commission Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule. On July 20, 2023, the Court denied
Walmart's motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal, ﬁnding that it would be more
orderly to consider a request for interlocutory appeal after a ruling on Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended
complaint. Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was ﬁled on August 11, 2023, and remains
pending. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no
assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss
that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, ﬁnancial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows will not be materially adversely aﬀected.

Mexico Antitrust Matter. On October 6, 2023, the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica of México
("COFECE") notiﬁed the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), a
majority owned subsidiary of the Company, that COFECE's Investigatory Authority ("IA") had requested COFECE to
initiate a quasi-judicial administrative process against Walmex's subsidiary for alleged relative monopolistic
practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing
practices of such consumer goods and related services. The quasi-judicial administrative process is the ﬁrst
opportunity for Walmex's subsidiary to respond to and defend against the IA's allegations before COFECE. While
COFECE has the authority to impose monetary relief and/or non-structural conduct measures, such relief and
conduct measures would be subject to appeal by Walmex's subsidiary. Walmex's subsidiary intends to defend
against the allegations vigorously, both at the quasi-judicial administrative process and, if required, before any
courts. Because this process is at an early stage, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and
outcome of these matters, cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise and can provide no
assurance that its business, ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows will not be materially adversely
aﬀected.

Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue

Segments

The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites,
located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's
operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The
Company deﬁnes its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM")
regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and
services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual
products and services.

The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce,
which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business oﬀerings such as advertising services through
Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as
well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership
clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of
corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.

The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and
operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises
the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead
allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a
segment signiﬁcantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassiﬁed to be comparable to the
current period's presentation.

In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From
time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category.
When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassiﬁed to be comparable to the current period's
presentation.

In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales,
where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulﬁlled through a store or club.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s ("Walmart," the "Company," "our," or "we") results for periods
occurring in the ﬁscal year ending January 31, 2024 ("ﬁscal 2024") and the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2023
("ﬁscal 2023"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for
the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
January 31, 2023, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31,
2023.

We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our ﬁnancial
statements, the changes in certain key items in those ﬁnancial statements from period to period and the primary
factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to
assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the ﬁnancial results of
each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and
its results of operations aﬀect the ﬁnancial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.

Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss
segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the
results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead
allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating
income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision
maker.

Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing
stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the
corresponding prior year period. Walmart's deﬁnition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open
for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce
sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel
transactions which are fulﬁlled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business oﬀerings that are part
of our strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are
excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion
that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than ﬁve percent. Sales related to divested
businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such
acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others
within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result,
our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies.

In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use
to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars.
We calculate the eﬀect of changes in currency exchange rates as the diﬀerence between current period activity
translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency
exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until
owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of
currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net
sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.

Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results diﬀerently. Each, however, has generally
maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent
years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to ﬂuctuations
in currency exchange rates.

We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong
sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and
supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses and companies that oﬀer services in digital advertising, fulﬁllment
and delivery services, health and wellness, and ﬁnancial services. Many of these competitors are national, regional
or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with
a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates"). We, along with other retail
companies, are inﬂuenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and
other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income,
consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory
management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations, customer preferences, deﬂation,
inﬂation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and
costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariﬀs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.

We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by
everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have experienced continued inﬂation that impacts our
merchandise costs. The impact to our net sales and gross proﬁt margin is inﬂuenced in part by our pricing and
merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to:
absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing
prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when
necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not
limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on
private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating
purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may
continue to impact gross proﬁt as a percentage of net sales.

Further information on the factors that can aﬀect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an
investment in our securities can be found herein under "Item 5. Other Information."

We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inﬂation, a
challenging macro environment, geopolitical conditions, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends
and consumer conﬁdence. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to
"Results of Operations" below.

Company Performance Metrics

We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by
everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive
positions in the countries in which we operate.  We deﬁne our ﬁnancial priorities as follows:

• Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;

• Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and

business mix; and

•

Returns - improve our Return on Investment ("ROI") through margin improvement and disciplined capital
spend.

Growth

Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to
shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through
increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion
of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.

Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the
change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the
corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail
calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales
using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below,
we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our ﬁscal calendar, which may result in
diﬀerences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S.
as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency,
one inﬂationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.

Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023
and 2022, were as follows:

Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.6% and 5.5% for the three and nine months ended
October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The Walmart U.S.
segment had comparable sales growth of 4.9% and 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023,
respectively, driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in
grocery and health and wellness. The increases were partially oﬀset by a modest decrease in general merchandise
sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% and 2.7% to
comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven
by store pickup and delivery.

Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 2.9% and 2.4% for the three and nine months ended
October 31, 2023, respectively. Growth in comparable sales beneﬁted from growth in transactions and average
ticket, including strong sales in

grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales for the nine months were partially oﬀset by lower fuel sales due
to deﬂation in this category. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately
1.4% and 1.6% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which
was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home.

Margin

Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a
combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and
process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs, and we operate with
discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the eﬃciency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of
businesses, including the expansion of connected value streams with higher margins, such as advertising. Our
objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we deﬁne as growing operating income at a faster rate
than net sales.

Gross proﬁt as a percentage of net sales ("gross proﬁt rate") increased 32 and 22 basis points for the three and
nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year.
The increases were primarily due to the timing of Flipkart's The Big Billion Days ("BBD") sales event in the Walmart
International segment, which shifted from the third quarter of ﬁscal 2023 to the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2024, a
reduction in inﬂation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment and a slight improvement in gross proﬁt rate
in the Walmart U.S. segment.

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 182 and 70 basis points for the three and nine months
ended October 31, 2023, respectively. The decreases were primarily driven by the lapping of opioid-related legal
settlements of $3.3 billion recorded in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2023.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 211 and 85 basis points for the three and nine months
ended October 31, 2023, respectively, due to the factors described above.

Returns

As we execute our strategic priorities, focusing on high return investments that drive operating leverage, we
believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment
and free cash ﬂow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which
are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

Return on Assets and Return on Investment

We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our ﬁnancial statements
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP") and Return on
Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure,
management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how
eﬀectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-
term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.5% and 3.7% for the trailing twelve months
ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in
consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges
incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1% and 12.8% for the trailing twelve months ended
October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income
primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially oﬀset by an
increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment.

We deﬁne ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the
trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital
to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and
amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.

20

Table of Contents

Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure because we calculate ROI using ﬁnancial
measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP
ﬁnancial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported
operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to
be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.
ROI diﬀers from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the
period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and
adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more
accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although
ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the
method used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to
calculate their ROI.

The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable
GAAP ﬁnancial measure, is as follows:

Strategic Capital Allocation

Our strategy includes allocating the majority of our capital to higher-return areas focused on automation such as
eCommerce, supply chain and store and club investments. The following table provides additional detail regarding

Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow,
which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial
measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be considered in
addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash
provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of
GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash
used in ﬁnancing activities.

We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and
equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months
ended October 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the
prior year. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory
purchases, partially oﬀset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash ﬂow for the nine
months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of $0.7 billion when compared to
the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating cash ﬂows
described above, partially oﬀset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment
strategy.

Walmart's deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for
discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt
service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is
important to view free cash ﬂow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Although other companies report their free cash ﬂow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's
free cash ﬂow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may diﬀer from the
methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash ﬂow.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow, a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, to net cash provided
by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP ﬁnancial measure most directly comparable to free cash
ﬂow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in ﬁnancing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income,
increased $8.0 billion or 5.2% and $27.5 billion or 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increases were primarily due to
strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, which were driven by growth in
transactions, combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness,
along with positive comparable sales in most of our international markets. Net sales were positively impacted by
$1.4 billion and $1.7 billion of ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October
31, 2023, respectively.

Gross proﬁt rate increased 32 and 22 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increases were primarily due to
the shift in timing of the BBD sales event in the Walmart International segment, a reduction in inﬂation related LIFO
charges in the Sam's Club segment and a slight improvement in gross proﬁt rate in the Walmart U.S. segment.

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 182 and 70 basis points for the three and nine months
ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The
decreases were primarily driven by the lapping of opioid-related legal settlements of $3.3 billion recorded in the
third quarter of ﬁscal 2023.

Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our
investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can ﬂuctuate from period to period.
The net increase of $1.1 billion and net decrease of $1.5 billion in other losses for the three and nine months ended
October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year, were primarily due
to changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments driven by changes in their underlying stock prices.

Our eﬀective income tax rate was 29.7% and 26.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023,
respectively, compared to (23.5)% and 32.4% for the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increase in
eﬀective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous
ﬁscal year is primarily due to tax expense on a quarterly pre-tax loss during the third quarter of ﬁscal 2023, which
included charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and net losses in fair value of our investments. The
decrease in eﬀective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in
the previous ﬁscal year was primarily due to the tax impact of charges associated with opioid-related legal
settlements and net losses in fair value of our investments. Our eﬀective income tax rate may ﬂuctuate from
quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation
allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and
size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that
may be diﬀerent than the U.S. statutory rate.

As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $2.4 billion and $5.1 billion for the
three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous
ﬁscal year. Additionally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion for
the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which included stronger results from our Walmex
operations. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $0.17 and $3.71 for the
three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which represents respective increases of $0.83 and
$1.74 when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $4.6 billion or 4.4% and $17.4 billion or 5.7% for the three and
nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year.
The increases were due to comparable sales of 4.9% and 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31,
2023, respectively, driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales
in grocery and health and wellness. The increases were partially oﬀset by a modest decrease in general
merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% and
2.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily
driven by store pickup and delivery.

Gross proﬁt rate was relatively ﬂat, having increased by 5 and 3 basis points for the three and nine months ended
October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year.

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 35 basis points for the three months ended October 31,
2023 and was relatively ﬂat for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, when compared to the same periods in
the previous ﬁscal year. The increase for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to increases
in wage related expenses, store remodel costs and legal expenses.

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.1 billion and increased $0.8 billion for
the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the
previous ﬁscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $2.7 billion or 10.8% and $8.8 billion or 12.0% for the
three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous
ﬁscal year. The increases were primarily due to positive comparable sales in most of our international markets and
positive ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended
October 31, 2023, respectively. The increases were partially oﬀset by the shift in timing of the BBD sales event.

Gross proﬁt rate increased 151 and 44 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year, primarily driven by the shift in timing
of the BBD sales event, partially oﬀset by ongoing format and channel mix shifts and category mix shifts to food
and consumables.

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 75 basis points for the three months ended October 31,
2023 when compared to the same period in the previous ﬁscal year, primarily driven by the shift in timing of the
BBD sales event, partially oﬀset by format mix shifts in certain markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
sales decreased 53 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in
the previous ﬁscal year, primarily due to strong sales, format mix shifts and operating eﬃciencies in most of our
markets, partially oﬀset by the timing of the BBD sales event.

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.3 billion and $0.8 billion for the three and
nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year.
Additionally, the increase in operating income for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was partially oﬀset by
the lapping of a beneﬁt in membership and other income related to an insurance settlement for Walmart Chile in
the previous year.

We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the eﬀect of the Sam's Club

segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to
impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.6 billion or 2.8% and $1.4 billion or 2.2% for the three and nine
months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The
increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 2.9% and 2.4% for the three and nine months
ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Growth in comparable sales beneﬁted from growth in transactions and
average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales for the nine months
were partially oﬀset by lower fuel sales due to deﬂation in this category. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively
contributed approximately 1.4% and 1.6% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31,
2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home.

Gross proﬁt rate increased 16 and 64 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increase in gross proﬁt rate for
the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in inﬂation related LIFO charges,
partially oﬀset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories and investments in price. The increase in gross
proﬁt rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to the lapping of elevated supply chain
costs and a reduction in inﬂation related LIFO charges.

Membership and other income increased 4.5% and 5.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year. The increases were due to growth in
the membership base, Plus penetration and Plus renewals.

Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 13 and 57 basis points for the three and nine
months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous ﬁscal year,
primarily due to elevated technology spend and higher facilities costs. In addition, lower fuel sales contributed to
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the nine months ended October 31, 2023.

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income was relatively ﬂat and increased $0.1 billion for the
three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous
ﬁscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a signiﬁcant source of liquidity. Our
cash ﬂows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have
been suﬃcient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of
our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash ﬂow has been used to fund dividends on our
common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be suﬃcient to fund
operations, ﬁnance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the
next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion as compared to $15.7 billion for the nine months ended
October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and
moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially oﬀset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges.

Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deﬁcit

Cash and cash equivalents were $12.2 billion and $11.6 billion at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our
working capital deﬁcit was $15.8 billion as of October 31, 2023, which increased when compared to the $13.7
billion working capital deﬁcit as of October 31, 2022, primarily driven by timing of certain payments and an
increase in short-term borrowings, partially oﬀset by a decrease in current maturities of long-term debt. We
generally operate with a working capital deﬁcit due to our eﬃcient use of cash in funding operations, consistent
access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends
and share repurchases.

As of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion and $2.9 billion,
respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the
approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.

Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt,
dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are
also classiﬁed as cash ﬂows used in ﬁnancing activities. Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities was $0.2 billion as
compared to $5.6 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in net
cash used in ﬁnancing activities is primarily due to fewer repurchases of Company stock and an increase in short-
term borrowings, partially oﬀset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests and payments of long-term
debt.

In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as
well as its ﬁve-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion
at October 31, 2023, all undrawn.

During the nine months ended October 31, 2023, our total outstanding long-term debt increased $0.3 billion

term debt. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances and

Dividends

Eﬀective February 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the ﬁscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an
increase over the ﬁscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For ﬁscal 2024, the annual dividend was or will be
paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:

The dividend installments payable on April 3, 2023, May 30, 2023 and September 5, 2023 were paid as scheduled.

Company Share Repurchase Program

From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs
authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31,
2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has
no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of
October 31, 2023, authorization for $18.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase
program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share
repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our
results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share
repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash ﬂow. The following table provides, on a
settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022:

During the nine months ended October 31, 2023, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain
Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe.
Additionally, during the nine months ended October 31, 2023, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new
rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority-owned PhonePe subsidiary.

Material Cash Requirements

Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related
costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisﬁed by our cash
from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term
borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations.

Capital Resources

We believe our cash ﬂows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital
markets will continue to be suﬃcient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which
includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions,
dividend payments and share repurchases.

We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us
to reﬁnance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of October 31, 2023, the ratings
assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:

Rating agency

Standard & Poor's
Moody's Investors Service
Fitch Ratings

Long-term debt

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each
agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit
ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could aﬀect our credit ratings include changes in our
operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our ﬁnancial position,
including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit
ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital
and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term
credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same ﬂexibility that we
have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt
ﬁnancing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or
debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is speciﬁc to
the security to which it applies.

Other Matters

In Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies" and appears in
Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Financial Statements," we discuss, under the
sub-captions "Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation," and
"Other Opioid-Related Litigation," the Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, and other matters,

money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program and a government investigation by the U.S. Attorney's
Oﬃce for the Middle District of Pennsylvania into the Company's consumer fraud prevention and anti-money
laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer agent services. In Note 6, under the sub-caption
"Mexico Antitrust Matter," we also discuss a quasi-judicial process initiated by the Comision Federal de
Competencia Economica of Mexico against Walmex. We discuss various legal proceedings related to the
Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation and Opioids-Related Securities
Class Actions and Derivative Litigation; Asda Equal Value Claims; Money Transfer Agent Services Litigation; and
Mexico Antitrust Matter in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Legal
Proceedings," under the sub-caption "I. Supplemental Information." We also discuss items related to the Foreign
Direct Investment matter in India in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Legal
Proceedings," under the sub-caption "II. Certain Other Matters." We also discuss an environmental matter with the
State of California and an environmental matter with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Part II of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Legal Proceedings," under the sub-caption "III.
Environmental Matters." The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a
material liability by the Company upon their ﬁnal resolution.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and
the fair value of certain equity investments. As of October 31, 2023, there were no material changes to our market
risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2023. The information
concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended
January 31, 2023, as ﬁled with the SEC on March 17, 2023, under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk," is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

28

Table of Contents

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a
timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and
procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those
entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we
maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and make changes to our
systems and processes to improve such controls and increase eﬃciency, while ensuring that we maintain an
eﬀective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more eﬃcient
systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating
certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. In the ﬁrst quarter of
ﬁscal 2024, we began implementing a new ﬁnancial system, including our general ledger, in stages beginning in
our U.S. and Canadian markets. This ﬁnancial system is a signiﬁcant component of our internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of our new ﬁnancial system in stages, and
each implementation will impact our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

An evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer. Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
eﬀective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it ﬁles or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and are eﬀective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods speciﬁed by the SEC's rules and forms.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred
during the ﬁscal quarter ended October 31, 2023, that has materially aﬀected, or is reasonably likely to materially
aﬀect, the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain
regulatory matters, including responding to subpoenas and requests for information in connection with government
investigations. We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the
caption "Item 1. Financial Statements," in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
captioned "Contingencies," under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings." We refer you to that discussion for
important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known,
the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the
name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the
lawsuit was ﬁled.

Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The
MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 400 cases as of
November 15, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of
parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23,
2021, ﬁnding in favor of the plaintiﬀs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement
phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants,
including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over ﬁfteen years, on a joint and
several liability basis, and granted the plaintiﬀs injunctive relief. The Company has ﬁled an appeal with the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion
of the judgment went into eﬀect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
issued an order certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The MDL
designated ﬁve additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery, though those
bellwether plaintiﬀs have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework. On October 25, 2023, the MDL
designated four cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery. Additional
bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare providers may be designated in the future. In
addition, there are over 100 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country against the
Company as of November 15, 2023, as well as other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain
other subsidiaries of the Company. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are
listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a
Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits ﬁled against the Company by states,
political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that
previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S.
territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local
governments against the Company. As described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Settlement Framework became eﬀective on September 6, 2023.

DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has
been ﬁled by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of
the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et
al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company ﬁled a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021.
After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ ﬁled an amended complaint on October
7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company ﬁled a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion
remains pending.

Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two
securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been ﬁled in Delaware naming
the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former oﬃcers as defendants. The
plaintiﬀs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the
defendants breached their ﬁduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and
that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's
disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been ﬁled in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and
those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative
suit has been ﬁled in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the
Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiﬀs
responded by ﬁling an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to
dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the
Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company' s
distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the
litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation
Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former oﬃcers and directors
named in the various proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized

30

Table of Contents

the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out
its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its
investigation.

The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the
Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be ﬁled on behalf of a class of investors who acquired
Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in
Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiﬀ and lead counsel. The defendants moved to
dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiﬀs ﬁled an
amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock
from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the
amended complaint. That motion remains pending.

Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE,
4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery,
9/27/21.

Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et
al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation, USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21.

II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS
Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause
notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and
individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the
recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and
regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from
2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial
stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage,
lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is
determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary
and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses
to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend
against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to
predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the ﬁnal outcome of the resulting
proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse eﬀect on
its business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations or cash ﬂows, the Company can provide no assurance as to
the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the
Company may receive in indemniﬁcation from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the
2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no
assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse eﬀect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:  Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental
matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential
monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold of $1 million.

In December 2021, the Oﬃce of the Attorney General of the State of California ﬁled suit against the Company,
bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California
facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was ﬁled in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case
No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company
believes it has strong defenses and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict
the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million.
Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse eﬀect on its business,
ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash ﬂows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and
outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse eﬀect to its business or its
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2023, the Company received a Finding of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the
"EPA") alleging violations of the Clean Air Act in connection with the Company's refrigeration leak detection and
repair program at certain of its facilities. The Company is evaluating the ﬁndings and cooperating with the EPA in its
investigation. The EPA may seek to impose monetary and non-monetary penalties for the alleged violations of the
Clean Air Act. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict the ﬁnal
outcome of this matter. Although the Company does not believe this matter will have a material adverse eﬀect on
its business, ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash ﬂows, the Company can provide no assurance as to
the scope or outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse eﬀect to its
business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in
Part I, Item 1A, under the caption "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended
January 31, 2023, which risks could materially and adversely aﬀect our business, results of operations, ﬁnancial
condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk
factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be aﬀected by additional
factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our
business operations could also be aﬀected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S.
and globally. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs
authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended October 31,
2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has
no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of
October 31, 2023, authorization for $18.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase
program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to
execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of
borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase
program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2023, was as follows:

None of the Company's directors or executive oﬃcers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement
or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's ﬁscal quarter ended October 31, 2023, as such
terms are deﬁned under Item 408(a) or Regulation S-K.
