COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2024 OPERATING RESULTS
AND ANNOUNCES A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $15 PER SHARE

ISSAQUAH,  Wash.,  December  14,  2023  -  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  (“Costco”  or  the  “Company”)  (Nasdaq:
COST)  today  announced  its  operating  results  for  the  ﬁrst  quarter  (twelve  weeks)  of  ﬁscal  2024,  ended  November
26, 2023.

For the ﬁrst quarter the Company reported net sales of $56.72 billion, an increase of 6.1 percent from $53.44 billion
for the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal year 2023, ended November 20, 2022.

Net sales were beneﬁted by approximately one-half to one percent in the U.S. and worldwide from the shift of the
ﬁscal calendar, as a result of the ﬁfty-third week in ﬁscal year 2023.

The following comparable sales reﬂect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks.
