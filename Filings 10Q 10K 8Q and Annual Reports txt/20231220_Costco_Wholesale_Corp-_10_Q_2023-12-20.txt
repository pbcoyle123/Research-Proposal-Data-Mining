COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
(unaudited)

Note 1—Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  (Costco  or  the  Company),  a  Washington  corporation,  and  its  subsidiaries  operate
membership  warehouses  based  on  the  concept  that  oﬀering  members  low  prices  on  a  limited  selection  of
nationally-branded  and  private-label  products  in  a  wide  range  of  merchandise  categories  will  produce  high  sales
volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At November 26, 2023, Costco operated 870 warehouses worldwide: 599 in
the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 108 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 33 in
Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 18 in Korea, 15 in Australia,14 in Taiwan, ﬁve in China, four in Spain, two in
France,  and  one  each  in  Iceland,  New  Zealand,  and  Sweden.  The  Company  operates  e-commerce  websites  in  the
U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.

Basis of Presentation

The condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of Costco and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All  material  inter-company  transactions  among  the  Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  been
eliminated in consolidation.

These  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the
instructions to Form 10-Q for interim ﬁnancial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  While  these  statements  reﬂect  all  normal  recurring  adjustments  that  are,  in  the
opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all
of  the  information  and  footnotes  required  by  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (U.S.  GAAP)  for
complete ﬁnancial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements should be read
in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  and  notes  included  in  the  Company's  Annual  Report  on
Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended September 3, 2023.

Fiscal Year End

The  Company  operates  on  a  52/53  week  ﬁscal  year  basis,  with  the  ﬁscal  year  ending  on  the  Sunday  closest  to
August  31.  Fiscal  2024  is  a  52-week  year  ending  on  September  1,  2024.  References  to  the  ﬁrst  quarter
of 2024 and 2023 relate to the 12-week ﬁscal quarters ended November 26, 2023, and November 20, 2022.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  ﬁnancial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the
Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could diﬀer from those estimates and assumptions.

Reclassiﬁcation

Reclassiﬁcations  were  made  to  the  condensed  consolidated  statement  of  cash  ﬂows  for  the  ﬁrst  twelve  weeks  of
ﬁscal 2023 to conform with current year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In  November  2023,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2023-07,  which  is  intended  to  improve  reportable  segment  disclosure
requirements,  primarily  through  additional  disclosures  about  signiﬁcant  segment  expenses.  The  standard  is
eﬀective for ﬁscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within ﬁscal years beginning after
December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior
periods  presented  in  the  ﬁnancial  statements.  The  Company  is  evaluating  the  disclosure  requirements  related  to
the new standard.

At  November  26,  2023,  and  September  3,  2023,  the  Company  did  not  hold  any  Level  1  or  3  ﬁnancial  assets  or
liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during the

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as ﬁnancial
assets  measured  at  amortized  cost  and  long-lived  nonﬁnancial  assets.  These  assets  are  measured  at  fair  value  if
determined to be impaired. There were no material fair value adjustments to these items during the ﬁrst quarter of
2024.  During  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  2023,  the  Company  recognized  in  merchandise  costs  a  charge  of  $93,  primarily
related to the impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping activities.

Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

The  Company  is  involved  in  many  claims,  proceedings  and  litigations  arising  from  its  business  and  property
ownership.  In  accordance  with  applicable  accounting  guidance,  the  Company  establishes  an  accrual  for  legal
proceedings  if  and  when  those  matters  present  loss  contingencies  that  are  both  probable  and  reasonably
estimable.  There  may  be  losses  in  excess  of  amounts  accrued.  The  Company  monitors  those  matters  for
developments  that  would  aﬀect  the  likelihood  of  a  loss  (taking  into  account  where  applicable  indemniﬁcation
arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount
as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with

12

Table of Contents

respect  to  certain  matters  described  below,  in  addition  to  other  immaterial  accruals  for  matters  not  described
below.  If  the  loss  contingency  at  issue  is  not  both  probable  and  reasonably  estimable,  the  Company  does  not
establish  an  accrual,  but  monitors  for  developments  that  make  the  contingency  both  probable  and  reasonably
estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of
the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including
any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other
things: the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspeciﬁed; the legal and/or factual theories are not
well developed; and/or the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.

The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate,
will  have  a  material  adverse  eﬀect  on  the  Company’s  ﬁnancial  position,  results  of  operations  or  cash  ﬂows;  it  is
possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that
might be material to the results of an individual ﬁscal quarter or year.

OVERVIEW

The  following  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  (MD&A)  is
intended  to  promote  understanding  of  the  results  of  operations  and  ﬁnancial  condition.  MD&A  is  provided  as  a
supplement  to,  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  condensed  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  and  the
accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated ﬁnancial
statements,  the  accompanying  Notes  to  Financial  Statements,  and  the  related  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  ﬁscal  year  2023  Form  10-K,  ﬁled  with  the  United
States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2023.

We  operate  membership  warehouses  and  e-commerce  websites  based  on  the  concept  that  oﬀering  our  members
low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will
produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating eﬃciencies achieved
by  volume  purchasing,  eﬃcient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-service
warehouse  facilities,  these  volumes  and  turnover  enable  us  to  operate  proﬁtably  at  signiﬁcantly  lower  gross
margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required
to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.

We believe that the most important driver of our proﬁtability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales.
Net  sales  includes  our  core  merchandise  categories  (foods  and  sundries,  non-foods,  and  fresh  foods),  warehouse
ancillary  (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-
commerce, business centers, travel and other). Comparable sales is

17

Table of Contents

deﬁned  as  net  sales  from  warehouses  open  for  more  than  one  year,  including  remodels,  relocations  and
expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended
as  supplemental  information  and  is  not  a  substitute  for  net  sales  presented  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  (U.S.  GAAP).  Comparable  sales  growth  is  achieved  through  increasing  shopping
frequency  from  new  and  existing  members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales
comparisons  can  also  be  particularly  inﬂuenced  by  certain  factors  that  are  beyond  our  control:  ﬂuctuations  in
currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inﬂation or deﬂation and changes in the cost
of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The  higher  our  comparable  sales  exclusive  of  these  items,  the
more  we  can  leverage  our  SG&A  expenses,  reducing  them  as  a  percentage  of  sales  and  enhancing  proﬁtability.
Generating  comparable  sales  growth  is  foremost  a  question  of  making  available  to  our  members  the  right
merchandise  at  the  right  prices,  a  skill  that  we  believe  we  have  repeatedly  demonstrated  over  the  long-term.
Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the
eﬀects of inﬂation or deﬂation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted
by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global,  national  and  regional
wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict
general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful  historically  in
adapting  our  business  to  these  changes,  such  as  through  adjustments  to  our  pricing  and  merchandise  mix,
including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online oﬀerings.

Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in
the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among
our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  –  consistently  providing  the  most  competitive  values.  Our  investments  in
merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on  merchandise  to  drive  sales  or  meet  competition  and  holding
prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting
gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).

We  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traﬃc  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin
percentage  and  lower  SG&A  expense,  relative  to  our  non-gasoline  businesses.  A  higher  penetration  of  gasoline
sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may signiﬁcantly impact
our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices beneﬁt net sales growth which, given the higher
sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of
net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse eﬀect.

Government actions in various countries relating to tariﬀs, particularly China and the United States, have aﬀected
the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type
of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariﬀs. Higher tariﬀs could adversely impact our results.

We  also  achieve  net  sales  growth  by  opening  new  warehouses.  As  our  warehouse  base  grows,  available  and
desirable  sites  become  more  diﬃcult  to  secure,  and  square  footage  growth  becomes  a  comparatively  less
substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating
proﬁtability  relative  to  existing  warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings
occur  in  existing  markets,  are  continuing  to  decline  in  signiﬁcance  as  they  relate  to  the  results  of  our  total
operations.  Our  rate  of  square  footage  growth  is  generally  higher  in  foreign  markets,  due  to  the  smaller  base  in
those  markets,  and  we  expect  that  to  continue.  Our  e-commerce  business,  domestically  and  internationally,
generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations.

The  membership  format  is  an  integral  part  of  our  business  and  has  a  signiﬁcant  eﬀect  on  our  proﬁtability.  This
format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve
growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members,

18

Table of Contents

and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially  inﬂuences  our  proﬁtability.  Our  paid-membership  growth  rate  may  be
adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.

Our ﬁnancial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes
in  this  area,  some  signiﬁcant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.
With  respect  to  the  compensation  of  our  employees,  our  philosophy  is  not  to  seek  to  minimize  their  wages  and
beneﬁts.  Rather,  we  believe  that  achieving  our  longer-term  objectives  of  reducing  employee  turnover  and
enhancing  employee  satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry
average  for  much  of  our  workforce.  This  may  cause  us,  for  example,  to  absorb  costs  that  other  employers  might
seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in
various  items  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&A  expenses,  can
have substantial impacts on net income.

Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments
(see Note 9 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in
the  Other  International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  beneﬁt
costs  as  a  percentage  of  sales,  less  or  no  direct  membership  warehouse  competition,  or  lack  e-commerce  or
business delivery.

In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar, which are diﬀerences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the ﬁnancial results
of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes
is calculated based on the diﬀerence between the current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes
in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the diﬀerence between the current and prior period's average
price per gallon sold. Results expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices are intended
as  supplemental  information  and  are  not  a  substitute  for  net  sales  presented  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and
should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Our ﬁscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 and 2023 relate to
the 12-week ﬁscal quarters ended November 26, 2023, and November 20, 2022. Certain percentages presented are
calculated using actual results prior to rounding.

Highlights for the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 versus 2023 include:

• Net  sales  increased  6%  to  $56,717,  driven  by  a  4%  increase  in  comparable  sales  and  sales  at  25  net  new

warehouses opened since the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2023;

• Membership  fee  revenue  increased  8%  to  $1,082,  driven  by  new  member  sign-ups,  upgrades  to  Executive

Membership, and a higher renewal rate;

•

• Gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points, driven primarily by our warehouse operations and other
businesses  and  the  absence  of  a  charge  of  $93,  $0.15  per  diluted  share,  predominantly  related  to  the
discontinuation of our charter shipping activities, which was recorded in the ﬁrst quarter of 2023;
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 25 basis points, primarily due to increased costs in
warehouse operations and other businesses, including the impact of wage increases in March and September
2023;
The  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  2024  was  positively  impacted  by  a  beneﬁt  related  to
stock  compensation  of  $44,  $0.10  per  diluted  share,  compared  to  $53,  $0.12  per  diluted  share,  in  the  ﬁrst
quarter of 2023;

•

• Net income was $1,589, $3.58 per diluted share, compared to $1,364, $3.07 per diluted share in 2023;
•

A quarterly cash dividend of $1.02 per share was declared on October 18, 2023, and paid on November 17,
2023; and
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on December 13, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a special cash
dividend of $15.00 per share, payable January 12, 2024.

Net  sales  increased  $3,280  or  6%,  during  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  2024.  The  improvement  was  attributable  to  an
increase  in  comparable  sales  of  4%,  and  sales  at  the  25  net  new  warehouses  opened  since  the  end  of  the  ﬁrst
quarter of 2023. Sales increased $2,921, or 7% in core merchandise categories, led by fresh foods and foods and
sundries. Sales in warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased $359, or 3%, led by pharmacy.

During  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  2024,  lower  gasoline  prices  negatively  impacted  net  sales  by  $341,  64  basis  points,
compared to 2023, with a 4% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the
U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $195, 36 basis points, compared to the ﬁrst quarter of
2023, attributable to our Other International operations, partially oﬀset by our Canadian operations.

Comparable Sales

Comparable sales increased 4% in the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping
frequency, partially oﬀset by a slight decrease in average ticket.

Membership fee revenue increased 8%, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and a
higher renewal rate. At the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, our renewal rates were 92.8% in the U.S. and Canada
and  90.5%  worldwide.  Renewal  rates  beneﬁted  from  higher  penetration  of  Executive  members.  Our  renewal  rate,
which  excludes  aﬃliates  of  Business  members,  is  a  trailing  calculation  that  captures  renewals  during  the  period

Gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deﬂation on net sales,
gross  margin  percentage  was  10.97%,  an  increase  of  36  basis  points.  The  36  basis-point  increase  was  positively
impacted  by:  22  basis  points  related  to  our  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses,  primarily  gasoline  and  e-
commerce;  17  basis  points  due  to  the  absence  of  a  charge  related  to  the  discontinuation  of  our  charter  shipping
activities that was recorded in the ﬁrst quarter of 2023; and three basis points due to a LIFO beneﬁt. These were
partially  oﬀset  by:  three  basis  points  due  to  core  merchandise  categories,  predominantly  fresh  foods;  and  three
basis points due to increased 2% rewards.

The  gross  margin  in  core  merchandise  categories,  when  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  core  merchandise  sales
(rather  than  total  net  sales),  increased  ﬁve  basis  points.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  non-foods,  partially
oﬀset by fresh foods and foods and sundries. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration
and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.

Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the
impact  of  changes  in  gasoline  prices  on  net  sales  (segment  gross  margin  percentage),  increased  across  all
segments.  Our  U.S.  segment  performed  similarly  to  the  results  above.  The  increases  in  our  Canadian  and  Other
International  segments  were  primarily  due  to  increases  in  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses  and  core
merchandise categories. All segments were negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards.

Our  primary  sources  of  liquidity  are  cash  ﬂows  from  operations,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term
investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $17,864 and $15,234 at November 26,
2023,  and  September  3,  2023.  Of  these  balances,  unsettled  credit  and  debit  card  receivables  represented
approximately  $2,603  and  $2,282  at  November  26,  2023,  and  September  3,  2023.  These  receivables  generally
settle within four days.

Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations,
long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations.

Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the
majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts
primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other
than leases) are due in the next 12 months.

Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash ﬂows with capacity under existing
and available credit agreements will be suﬃcient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable
future.  We  believe  that  our  U.S.  current  and  projected  asset  position  is  suﬃcient  to  meet  our  U.S.  liquidity
requirements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4,651 in the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, compared to $2,610 in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2023. Our cash ﬂow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash ﬂow
used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including
payroll  and  employee  beneﬁts,  utilities,  and  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees.  Cash  used  in  operations  also
includes  payments  for  income  taxes.  Changes  in  our  net  investment  in  merchandise  inventories  (the  diﬀerence
between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including inventory levels
and turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with suppliers, and
early payments to obtain discounts.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net  cash  used  in  investing  activities  totaled  $366  in  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  2024,  compared  to  $1,057  in  the  ﬁrst
quarter  of  2023,  and  is  primarily  related  to  capital  expenditures.  Net  cash  from  investing  activities  also  includes
purchases and maturities of short-term investments.

Capital Expenditure Plans

Our  primary  requirements  for  capital  are  acquiring  land,  buildings,  and  equipment  for  new  and  remodeled
warehouses.  Capital  is  also  required  for  information  systems,  manufacturing  and  distribution  facilities,  initial
warehouse operations, and working capital. In the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, we spent $1,040 on capital expenditures,
and it is our current intention to spend approximately $4,400 to $4,600 during ﬁscal 2024. These expenditures are
expected  to  be  ﬁnanced  with  cash  from  operations,  existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term
investments. We opened 10 new warehouses, including one relocation, in the

23

Table of Contents

ﬁrst quarter of 2024 and plan to open 23 additional new warehouses, including one relocation, in the remainder of
ﬁscal 2024. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change
upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities totaled $974 in the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, compared to $863 in the ﬁrst quarter
of 2023. Cash ﬂow used in ﬁnancing activities during the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 was primarily related to the payment
of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. In November 2023, our
Japanese  subsidiary  issued  four  Guaranteed  Senior  Notes  totaling  approximately  $500  at  ﬁxed  interest  rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%.

Dividends

A quarterly cash dividend of $1.02 per share was declared on October 18, 2023, payable to shareholders of record
on November 3, 2023, which was paid on November 17, 2023.

Subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  quarter,  on  December  13,  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  declared  a  special  cash
dividend  of  $15.00  per  share,  payable  January  12,  2024,  to  shareholders  of  record  as  of  the  close  of  business  on
December 28, 2023. The aggregate amount of payments will be approximately $6.7 billion.

Share Repurchase Program

On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which
expires in January 2027. During the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 288,000 and 285,000 shares of
common  stock,  at  an  average  price  per  share  of  $564.06  and  $495.94,  totaling  approximately  $162  and  $141.
These  amounts  may  diﬀer  from  the  accompanying  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  cash  ﬂows  due  to
changes  in  unsettled  repurchases  at  the  end  of  a  quarter.  Purchases  are  made  from  time  to  time,  as  conditions
warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares
are  retired,  in  accordance  with  the  Washington  Business  Corporation  Act.  The  remaining  amount  available  to  be
purchased under our approved plan was $3,401 at the end of the ﬁrst quarter.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs

We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 26, 2023, we
had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,245. Our international operations maintain $757 of this capacity
under bank credit facilities, of which $163 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under
the  bank  credit  facilities,  which  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets,  were
immaterial at the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 and at the end of ﬁscal 2023.

The  Company  has  letter  of  credit  facilities,  for  commercial  and  standby  letters  of  credit,  totaling  $223.  The
outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 totaled $188, most of which
were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities
have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount
of  borrowings  available  at  any  time  under  our  bank  credit  facilities  is  reduced  by  the  amount  of  standby  and
commercial letters of credit outstanding.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The  preparation  of  our  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  requires  that  we  make
estimates  and  judgments.  We  base  these  on  historical  experience  and  on  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be
reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report

ﬁle  or  submit  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized,  and  reported  within  the  time  periods
speciﬁed in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required
to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and ﬁnancial
oﬃcers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Oﬃcer and the Chief Financial Oﬃcer,
with  assistance  from  other  members  of  management,  have  reviewed  the  eﬀectiveness  of  our  disclosure  controls
and procedures as of November 26, 2023, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls
and procedures were eﬀective as of such date.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting (as deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-
15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2024 that have materially aﬀected, or are
reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.

(i)1.5  times  the  sum  of  Annual  Base  Salary  and  Target  Bonus,  paid  in  a  single  lump  sum  cash

(ii)For  the  period  following  the  Termination  Date  until  Executive  is  ﬁrst  eligible  for  Medicare

dependents, will continue to be eligible to receive medical coverage under the Company’s medical plans in
accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  applicable  plan  documents;  provided,  that  in  order  to  receive  such
continued  coverage  at  such  rates,  Executive  will  be  required  to  pay  the  applicable  premiums  to  the  plan
provider, and the Company will reimburse Executive, within sixty (60) days following the date such monthly
premium  payment  is  due,  an  amount  equal  to  the  monthly  COBRA  premium  payment,  less  applicable  tax
withholdings.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  Executive  obtains  employment  during  this  period  that
entitles  him  and  his  spouse  and  eligible  dependents  to  comprehensive  medical  coverage,  Executive  must
notify the Company, and no further reimbursements will be paid by the Company to Executive pursuant to
this  subsection.  In  addition,  if  Executive  does  not  pay  the  applicable  monthly  COBRA  premium  for  a
particular month at any time and coverage is lost as a result, no further reimbursements will be paid by the
Company to Executive pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company determines
in  its  sole  discretion  that  it  cannot  provide  the  foregoing  COBRA  beneﬁts  without  potentially  violating
applicable  law  (including,  without  limitation,  section  2716  of  the  Public  Health  Service  Act),  the  Company
shall  in  lieu  thereof  provide  to  Executive  a  taxable  lump-sum  payment  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  monthly
(or then remaining) COBRA premium that Executive would be required to pay to continue his group health
coverage in eﬀect on the Termination Date (which amount shall be based on the premium for the ﬁrst month
of COBRA coverage).

(iii)Any  outstanding  stock  options  held  by  Executive  that  are  vested  and  exercisable  as  of  the
Termination Date shall remain exercisable, notwithstanding anything in any other agreement governing such
options, until the earlier of (A) a period of one year after the Termination Date, or (B) the original term of the
option.

(iv)Any  Restricted  Stock  Units  held  by  Executive  that  are  unvested  as  of  the  Termination  Date
shall vest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the applicable Grant Detail and Restricted Stock Unit
Award Agreement, any unvested Restricted Stock Units that so vest will be settled within three (3) business
days following the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date.

(v)Any  of  Executive’s  performance-based  Restricted  Stock  Units  (“PRUs”)  that  remain
outstanding  as  of  the  Termination  Date  shall  be  treated  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  a  written  letter
agreement  or  other  instrument  between  the  Company  and  Executive  (a  “PRU  Agreement”);  provided,
however,  that  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  the  PRU  Agreement,  none  of  the  PRUs  will  be
settled until after the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, but in any event by the sixty-ﬁfth
(65th) day following the last day of the applicable performance period for the PRUs

Good Reason.

(a)

Termination  on  Account  of  Disability.  Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Agreement  to  the

contrary, if Executive’s employment terminates on account of Disability, Executive shall be entitled

3

to  receive  disability  beneﬁts  subject  to  and  under  the  terms  of  any  disability  plan  or  program  maintained  by  the
Company  that  covers  Executive  (including  under  the  original  terms  of  any  stock  option  held  by  Executive),  and
Executive shall not receive payments or beneﬁts pursuant to Section 2, except that Executive shall be entitled to
the following beneﬁts, subject to Section 4:

(i)For  a  period  of  up  to  eighteen  (18)  months  following  the  Termination  Date,  Executive,  and
where applicable, Executive’s spouse and eligible dependents will continue to be eligible to receive medical
coverage  under  the  Company’s  medical  plans  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  applicable  plan
documents;  provided,  that  in  order  to  receive  such  continued  coverage  at  such  rates,  Executive  will  be
required  to  pay  the  applicable  premiums  to  the  plan  provider,  and  the  Company  will  reimburse  Executive,
within 60 days following the date such monthly premium payment is due, an amount equal to the monthly
COBRA  premium  payment,  less  applicable  tax  withholdings.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  Executive
obtains  employment  during  this  eighteen  (18)  month  period  that  entitles  him  and  his  spouse  and  eligible
dependents  to  comprehensive  medical  coverage,  Executive  must  notify  the  Company  and  no  further
reimbursements  will  be  paid  by  the  Company  to  Executive  pursuant  to  this  subsection.  In  addition,  if
Executive  does  not  pay  the  applicable  monthly  COBRA  premium  for  a  particular  month  at  any  time  during
the eighteen (18) month period and coverage is lost as a result, no further reimbursements will be paid by
the  Company  to  Executive  pursuant  to  this  subsection.  Notwithstanding  the  above,  if  the  Company
determines  in  its  sole  discretion  that  it  cannot  provide  the  foregoing  COBRA  beneﬁts  without  potentially
violating  applicable  law  (including,  without  limitation,  section  2716  of  the  Public  Health  Service  Act),  the
Company shall in lieu thereof provide to Executive a taxable lump-sum payment in an amount equal to the
monthly (or then remaining) COBRA premium that Executive would be required to pay to continue his group
health coverage in eﬀect on the Termination Date (which amount shall be based on the premium for the ﬁrst
month of COBRA coverage).

(ii)Any  Restricted  Stock  Units  held  by  Executive  that  are  unvested  as  of  the  Termination  Date
shall vest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the applicable Grant Detail and Restricted Stock Unit
Award Agreement, any unvested Restricted Stock Units that so vest will be settled within three (3) business
days following the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date.

(iii)Any of Executive’s PRUs that remain outstanding as of the Termination Date shall be treated
in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  PRU  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that  notwithstanding  anything  to
the  contrary  in  the  PRU  Agreement,  none  of  the  PRUs  will  be  settled  until  after  the  sixtieth  (60th)  day
following  the  Termination  Date,  but  in  any  event  by  the  sixty-ﬁfth  (65th)  day  following  the  last  day  of  the
applicable performance period for the PRUs.

(b)

Termination on Account of Death. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if  Executive’s  employment  terminates  on  account  of  death,  Executive  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  death  beneﬁts
under any death beneﬁt program maintained by the Company that covers Executive (including under the original
terms of any stock option or Restricted Stock Units held by Executive), and Executive shall not receive payments or
beneﬁts pursuant to Section 2, except that any of Executive’s PRUs that remain outstanding as of the date of death
shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the PRU Agreement.

(c)

Termination  on  Account  of  Cause.  Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Agreement  to  the
contrary, if Executive’s employment terminates by the Company on account of Cause, Executive shall not receive
beneﬁts pursuant to Section 2.

(d)

Termination  on  Account  of  Voluntary  Resignation  Without  Good  Reason.  Notwithstanding
anything  in  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  if  Executive’s  employment  terminates  on  account  of  a  resignation  by
Executive for no reason or any reason other than on account of Good Reason, Executive shall not receive payments
or beneﬁts pursuant to Section 2, except that any of

Executive’s PRUs that remain outstanding as of the Termination Date shall be treated in a manner consistent with
Section 2(b)(v) of this Agreement.

4.

Conditions on Certain Payments or Beneﬁts.

(a)

General  Release  of  Claims.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Agreement,  in
consideration of Executive’s receipt of the payments and beneﬁts described under Section 2(b) or Section 3(a), as
applicable, Executive agrees that, as a condition to his receipt of any such payments and beneﬁts, he shall timely
execute  (and  not  revoke  thereafter)  a  general  release  of  claims  (a  “Release”),  in  a  form  to  be  provided  by  the
Company,  releasing  any  and  all  claims  of  any  kind  arising  from  his  employment  or  the  termination  of  his
employment with the Company. To be timely, the Release must become eﬀective and irrevocable no later than ﬁfty-
ﬁve  (55)  days  following  the  date  of  Executive’s  termination  (the  “Release  Deadline”).  If  the  Release  does  not
become  eﬀective  and  irrevocable  by  the  Release  Deadline,  Executive  will  forfeit  any  rights  to  the  payments  and
beneﬁts under Section 2(b) or Section 3(a), as applicable.

(b)

Clawback Policies. All amounts payable under this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of

the Company’s “clawback” policies as in eﬀect from time to time.

5.

Accrued  Obligations.  To  the  extent  not  modiﬁed  by  this  Agreement,  Executive  shall  receive  any
amounts and beneﬁts earned, accrued, or owing but not yet paid to him as of the Termination Date in accordance
with the terms of any applicable employee beneﬁt plans, programs, policies and arrangements of the Company.

6.

Tax Matters.

(a)

Withholding  of  Taxes.  The  Company  may  withhold  from  any  amounts  payable  under  this
Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company determines it is required to withhold pursuant to
any applicable law.

(b)

Parachute  Excise  Tax.  In  the  event  that  any  amounts  payable  under  this  Agreement  or
otherwise to Executive would (i) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of section 280G of the Code
or any comparable successor provisions and (ii) but for this subsection would be subject to the excise tax imposed
by section 4999 of the Code or any comparable successor provisions (the “Excise Tax”), then such amounts payable
to Executive hereunder shall be either:

(i)provided to Executive in full; or

(ii)provided to Executive to the maximum extent that would result in no portion of such beneﬁts

being subject to the Excise Tax;

whichever of the foregoing amounts, when taking into account applicable federal, state, local and foreign income
and  employment  taxes,  the  Excise  Tax  and  any  other  applicable  taxes,  results  in  the  receipt  by  Executive,  on  an
after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of beneﬁts, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such beneﬁts may be
subject  to  the  Excise  Tax.  Unless  the  Company  and  Executive  otherwise  agree  in  writing,  any  determination
required  under  this  subsection  shall  be  made  in  writing  in  good  faith  by  a  nationally  recognized  accounting  ﬁrm
selected  by  the  Company  (the  “Accountants”).  In  the  event  of  a  reduction  in  beneﬁts  hereunder,  the  reduction  of
the  total  payments  shall  apply  as  follows,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  Section  11.9  of  the
Company’s  2019  Incentive  Plan,  as  it  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time,  unless  the  Company  and  Executive
otherwise agree in writing, and to the extent required by section 409A: (i) any cash severance payment due under
this Agreement shall be reduced; (ii) forfeiture of any acceleration of vesting of any equity-based awards subject to
section 409A of the Code, with the tranche that would vest last (without any such acceleration) ﬁrst being subject
to  forfeiture;  (iii)  any  acceleration  of  vesting  of  any  equity-based  awards  not  subject  to  section  409A  of  the  Code
shall remain as originally scheduled to vest, with the tranche that would vest last (without any such acceleration)
ﬁrst remaining as originally scheduled to vest, and (iv) reduction of all other payments and

5

beneﬁts in a manner and order of priority that provides Executive with the largest net after-tax value; provided that
such  other  payments  and  beneﬁts  of  equal  after-tax  present  value  shall  be  reduced  in  the  reverse  order  of
payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any reduction under this subsection shall be
structured in a manner intended to comply with section 409A of the Code. For purposes of making the calculations
required  by  this  subsection,  the  Accountants  may  make  reasonable  assumptions  and  approximations  concerning
applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good-faith interpretations concerning the application of the Code and
other applicable legal authority. The Company and Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and
documents  as  the  Accountants  may  reasonably  request  in  order  to  make  a  determination  under  this  subsection.
The  Company  shall  bear  all  costs  that  the  Accountants  may  reasonably  incur  in  connection  with  any  calculations
contemplated by this subsection.

If,  notwithstanding  any  reduction  described  in  this  subsection,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (“IRS”)
determines  that  Executive  is  liable  for  the  Excise  Tax  as  a  result  of  the  receipt  of  amounts  payable  under  this
Agreement or otherwise as described above, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within
thirty  (30)  days  after  a  ﬁnal  IRS  determination  or,  in  the  event  that  Executive  challenges  the  ﬁnal  IRS
determination,  a  ﬁnal  judicial  determination,  a  portion  of  such  amounts  equal  to  the  Repayment  Amount.  The
“Repayment  Amount”  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  beneﬁts  shall  be  the  smallest  such  amount,  if  any,  that  is
required  to  be  paid  to  the  Company  so  that  Executive’s  net  after-tax  proceeds  with  respect  to  any  payment  of
beneﬁts  (after  taking  into  account  the  payment  of  the  Excise  Tax  and  all  other  applicable  taxes  imposed  on  such
payment)  are  maximized.  The  Repayment  Amount  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  beneﬁts  shall  be  zero  if  a
Repayment  Amount  of  more  than  zero  would  not  result  in  Executive’s  net  after-tax  proceeds  with  respect  to  the
payment of such beneﬁts being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this paragraph, Executive
shall pay the Excise Tax.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, if (i) there is a reduction in the payment of beneﬁts
as described in this subsection, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment
of which would result in the maximization of Executive’s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive’s beneﬁts
had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to Executive
the  amount  by  which  those  beneﬁts  which  were  reduced  pursuant  to  this  subsection  as  soon  as  administratively
possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax; provided that, to the extent required by section 409A of the Code, the
reimbursement is made on or before the last day of Executive’s taxable year following the taxable year in which the
Excise Tax was paid; the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another beneﬁt; and
the amount subject to reimbursement in one year shall not aﬀect any other amounts eligible for reimbursement in
any other year.

7.

Employment Rights; Term of Agreement.

(a)

Employment  Rights.  Nothing  expressed  or  implied  in  this  Agreement  will  create  any  right  or
duty on the part of the Company or Executive to have Executive remain in the employment of the Company or any
subsidiary or aﬃliate of the Company.

(b)

Term  of  Agreement.  The  term  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  one  year  from  the  Eﬀective  Date,

and may be renewed for one or more additional one-year terms upon the written agreement of both parties.

8.

Successors and Binding Agreement.

(a)

The  Company  will  require  any  successor  (whether  direct  or  indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,
consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform
this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such
succession had taken place. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the beneﬁt of the Company and any
successor to the Company, including without limitation

6

any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether
by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor will thereafter be deemed the
“Company” for the purposes of this Agreement), but will not otherwise be assignable, transferable or delegable by
the Company.

(b)

This  Agreement  will  inure  to  the  beneﬁt  of  and  be  enforceable  by  Executive’s  personal  or
legal  representatives,  executors,  administrators,  successors,  heirs,  distributees  and  legatees.  This  Agreement  will
supersede the provisions of any employment, severance or other agreement between Executive and the Company
that relate to any matter that is also the subject of this Agreement, and such provisions in such other agreements
will be null and void.

(c)

This  Agreement  is  personal  in  nature,  and  neither  of  the  parties  hereto  will,  without  the
consent of the other, assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as
expressly provided in Sections 8(a) and 8(b). Without limiting the generality or eﬀect of the foregoing, Executive’s
right to receive payments hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation
of  a  security  interest,  or  otherwise,  other  than  by  a  transfer  by  Executive’s  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and
distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 8(c), the Company
will have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated.

9.

Notices. For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including without limitation notices,
consents, requests or approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed
to  have  been  duly  given  when  hand-delivered  or  dispatched  by  electronic  facsimile  transmission  (with  receipt
thereof orally conﬁrmed), or ﬁve (5) business days after having been mailed by United States registered or certiﬁed
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or three (3) business days after having been sent by a nationally
recognized  overnight  courier  service  such  as  FedEx  or  UPS,  addressed  to  the  Company  (to  the  attention  of  John
Sullivan,  Executive  Vice  President  and  General  Counsel)  at  its  principal  executive  oﬃce  and  to  Executive  at  his
principal  residence,  or  to  such  other  address  as  any  party  may  have  furnished  to  the  other  in  writing  and  in
accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address will be eﬀective only upon receipt.

10.

Section 409A of the Code.

(a)

Interpretation.  Notwithstanding  the  other  provisions  hereof,  this  Agreement  is  intended  to
comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable, and this Agreement shall be
interpreted  to  avoid  any  penalty  sanctions  under  section  409A  of  the  Code.  Accordingly,  all  provisions  herein,  or
incorporated  by  reference,  shall  be  construed  and  interpreted  to  comply  with  section  409A  of  the  Code  and,  if
necessary,  any  such  provision  shall  be  deemed  amended  to  comply  with  section  409A  of  the  Code  and  the
regulations thereunder. If any payment or beneﬁt cannot be provided or made at the time speciﬁed herein without
incurring sanctions under section 409A of the Code, then such beneﬁt or payment shall be provided in full at the
earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. Any amount payable under this Agreement that
constitutes deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code shall be paid at the time provided under this
Agreement  or  such  other  time  as  permitted  under  section  409A  of  the  Code.  No  interest  will  be  payable  with
respect to any amount paid within a time period permitted by, or delayed because of, section 409A of the Code. All
payments to be made upon the Termination Date under this Agreement that are deferred compensation subject to
section 409A of the Code may only be made upon a “separation from service” under section 409A of the Code. For
purposes  of  section  409A  of  the  Code,  each  payment  made  under  this  Agreement  shall  be  treated  as  a  separate
payment. In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment.

(b)

Payment  Delay.  To  the  maximum  extent  permitted  under  section  409A  of  the  Code,  the
payments  and  beneﬁts  provided  under  this  Agreement  are  intended  to  comply  with  the  “short-term  deferral
exception”  under  Treas.  Reg.  §  1.409A-1(b)(4),  and  any  remaining  amount  is  intended  to  comply  with  the
“separation pay exception” under Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii); provided, however, if

7

any amount payable to Executive during the six (6) month period following the Termination Date does not qualify
within  either  of  the  foregoing  exceptions  and  constitutes  deferred  compensation  subject  to  the  requirements  of
section 409A of the Code, then such amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Excess Amount.” If at the time
of Executive’s separation from service, the Company’s (or any entity required to be aggregated with the Company
under  section  409A  of  the  Code)  stock  is  publicly-traded  on  an  established  securities  market  or  otherwise  and
Executive is a “speciﬁed employee” (as deﬁned in section 409A of the Code and determined in the sole discretion
of the Company (or any successor thereto) in accordance with the Company’s (or any successor thereto) “speciﬁed
employee”  determination  policy),  then  the  Company  shall  postpone  the  commencement  of  the  payment  of  the
portion  of  the  Excess  Amount  that  is  payable  within  the  six  (6)  month  period  following  the  Termination  Date  with
the  Company  (or  any  successor  thereto)  for  six  (6)  months  following  the  Termination  Date  with  the  Company  (or
any successor thereto). The delayed Excess Amount shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive within ten (10) days
following  the  date  that  is  six  (6)  months  following  the  Termination  Date  with  the  Company  (or  any  successor
thereto). If Executive dies during such six (6) month period and prior to the payment of the portion of the Excess
Amount that is required to be delayed on account of section 409A of the Code, such Excess Amount shall be paid to
the  personal  representative  of  Executive’s  estate  within  sixty  (60)  days  after  Executive’s  death.  The  Company
makes  no  representation  that  any  or  all  of  the  payments  and  beneﬁts  provided  under  this  Agreement  will  be
exempt from or comply with section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude section 409A of the
Code from applying to any such payment or beneﬁt.

(c)

Reimbursements.  All  reimbursements  provided  under  this  Agreement  shall  be  made  or
provided  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  section  409A  of  the  Code,  including,  where  applicable,  the
requirement  that  (i)  any  reimbursement  is  for  expenses  incurred  during  Executive’s  lifetime  (or  during  a  shorter
period  of  time  speciﬁed  in  this  Agreement),  (ii)  the  amount  of  expenses  eligible  for  reimbursement  during  a
calendar  year  may  not  aﬀect  the  expenses  eligible  for  reimbursement  in  any  other  calendar  year,  (iii)  the
reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the taxable year following the year
in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for
another beneﬁt.

11.

Governing Law; Arbitration.

(a)

Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement
will  be  governed  by  and  construed  in  accordance  with  the  substantive  laws  of  the  State  of  Washington,  without
giving eﬀect to the principles of conﬂict of laws of such State.

(b)

Arbitration.  Any  controversies  or  claims  arising  out  of  or  relating  to  this  Agreement  or
Executive’s employment shall be fully and ﬁnally settled by conﬁdential arbitration in Seattle, Washington, before a
single  arbitrator.  Judgment  on  an  award  issued  by  the  arbitrator  may  be  entered  in  any  court  having  jurisdiction
thereof. The arbitrator shall be chosen (i) by agreement of the parties and need not be aﬃliated with any particular
organization,  but  (ii)  absent  agreement  of  the  parties,  the  arbitrator  shall  be  appointed  by  Judicial  Dispute
Resolution (“JDR”) in Seattle, Washington, and if JDR is unable to do so, by Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services,
in  Seattle,  Washington.  Absent  agreement  of  the  parties  to  the  contrary,  discovery  and  motion  practice  in  the
arbitration shall be governed by the Washington Civil Rules and the Local Rules of King County Superior Court, with
the  understanding  that  the  arbitrator  may,  at  his  or  her  discretion,  limit  the  extent  and  scope  of  discovery,  and
determine the permissibility of pre-hearing dispositive motions. The arbitrator shall fully and ﬁnally determine any
and all questions of arbitrability. Conﬁdentiality of the arbitration is at the request of, and for the beneﬁt of, both
parties. The Company shall be responsible for payment of any and all costs and arbitrator fees of such arbitration.
Either  party  shall  have  the  right  to  seek  emergency  injunctive  relief  in  court  in  aid  of  arbitration  to  preserve  the
status  quo  pending  determination  of  the  merits  in  arbitration.  Venue  and  jurisdiction  for  any  such  action  for
injunctive relief shall exist exclusively in state and federal courts in King County, Washington.

8

12.

Validity. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or
circumstance  is  held  invalid,  unenforceable  or  otherwise  illegal,  the  remainder  of  this  Agreement  and  the
application of such provision to any other person or circumstances will not be aﬀected, and the provision so held to
be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal will be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to
make it enforceable, valid or legal.

13.

Miscellaneous.  No  provision  of  this  Agreement  may  be  modiﬁed,  waived  or  discharged  unless  such
waiver,  modiﬁcation  or  discharge  is  agreed  to  in  a  writing  signed  by  Executive  and  the  Company.  No  waiver  by
either  party  hereto  at  any  time  of  any  breach  by  the  other  party  hereto  or  compliance  with  any  condition  or
provision  of  this  Agreement  to  be  performed  by  such  other  party  will  be  deemed  a  waiver  of  similar  or  dissimilar
provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or
otherwise, expressed or implied with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are
not set forth expressly in this Agreement. References to Sections are to references to Sections of this Agreement.
Any  reference  in  this  Agreement  to  a  provision  of  a  statute,  rule  or  regulation  will  also  include  any  successor
provision thereto.

14.

Board Membership. At each meeting of the Company’s shareholders prior to the Termination Date at
which Executive’s board term is expiring, the Company will nominate Executive to serve as a member of the Board,
subject  to  required  stockholder  approval  and  compliance  with  the  Company’s  policies  and  procedures  regarding
service  as  a  member  of  the  Board.  Upon  the  termination  of  Executive’s  employment  for  any  reason,  unless
otherwise  requested  by  the  Board,  Executive  agrees  to  resign  from  the  Board  (and  all  other  positions  held  at  the
Company and its aﬃliates), and Executive, at the Board’s request, will execute any documents necessary to reﬂect
his resignation.

15.

Indemniﬁcation  and  D&O  Insurance.  Executive  will  be  provided  indemniﬁcation  to  the  extent
permitted  by  the  Company’s  and  its  subsidiaries’  and  aﬃliates’  Articles  of  Incorporation  or  Bylaws,  including,  if
applicable,  any  directors  and  oﬃcers  insurance  policies,  and  in  accordance  with  his  existing  indemniﬁcation
agreement with the Company.

16.

Employee Beneﬁts. Executive will be eligible to participate in the Company employee beneﬁt plans,
programs, policies and arrangements that are applicable to other executive oﬃcers of the Company, as such plans,
programs, policies and arrangements may exist from time to time and on terms at least as favorable as provided to
any other executive oﬃcer of the Company.

17.

Business  Expenses.  Executive  will  be  reimbursed  for  all  reasonable  expenses  incurred  by  him  in
performing  his  duties  hereunder  provided  that  such  expenses  are  incurred  and  accounted  for  in  accordance  with
the policies and procedures established by the Company.

18.

No  Duplication  of  Beneﬁts.  The  payments  and  beneﬁts  provided  under  this  Agreement  shall  oﬀset

substantially similar beneﬁts provided to Executive pursuant to another Company policy, plan or agreement.

19.

Survival.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  the  parties’  respective
rights  and  obligations  under  Section  2  will  survive  any  termination  or  expiration  of  this  Agreement  or  the
termination of Executive’s employment for any reason whatsoever.

20.

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be

deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
