On January 16, 2024, Target Corporation (“Target”) appointed Michael J. Fiddelke to the position of Executive Vice
President  and  Chief  Operating  Oﬃcer,  eﬀective  February  4,  2024.  In  addition,  Mr.  Fiddelke  will  retain  his

employed  by  Target  since  2004,  most  recently  as  Executive  Vice  President  and  Chief  Financial  Oﬃcer  (November
2019  to  present),  Senior  Vice  President,  Operations  (August  2018  to  October  2019),  and  Senior  Vice  President,
