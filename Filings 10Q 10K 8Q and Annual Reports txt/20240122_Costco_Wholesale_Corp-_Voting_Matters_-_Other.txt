Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995.  For  these  purposes,  forward-looking  statements  are  statements
that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in
the  future.  In  some  cases  forward-looking  statements  can  be  identiﬁed  because  they  contain  words  such  as
“anticipate,”  “believe,”  “continue,”  “could,”  “estimate,”  “expect,”  “intend,”  “likely,”  “may,”  “might,”  “plan,”
“potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions and the negatives
of  those  terms.  Such  forward-looking  statements  involve  risks  and  uncertainties  that  may  cause  actual  events,
results or performance to diﬀer materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions, including exchange rates, inﬂation
or deﬂation, the eﬀects of competition and regulation, uncertainties in the ﬁnancial markets, consumer and small
business  spending  patterns  and  debt  levels,  breaches  of  security  or  privacy  of  member  or  business  information,
conditions  aﬀecting  the  acquisition,  development,  ownership  or  use  of  real  estate,  capital  spending,  actions  of
vendors,  rising  costs  associated  with  employees  (generally  including  health-care  costs),  energy  and  certain
commodities,  geopolitical  conditions  (including  tariﬀs  and  the  Ukraine  conﬂict),  the  ability  to  maintain  eﬀective
internal  control  over  ﬁnancial  reporting,  regulatory  and  other  impacts  related  to  climate  change,  public-health
related  factors,  and  other  risks  identiﬁed  from  time  to  time  in  the  Company’s  public  statements  and  reports  ﬁled
with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  Forward-looking  statements  speak  only  as  of  the  date  they  are
made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Comparable
sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended
