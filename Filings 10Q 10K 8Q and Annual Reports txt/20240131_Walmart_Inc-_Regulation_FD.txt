Walmart Announces 3-for-1 Stock Split
Split aimed at helping associates take advantage of long-standing stock purchase beneﬁts

Exhibit 99.1

BENTONVILLE, Ark., Jan. 30, 2024 – Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) announced that it will conduct a
split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 3:1. The stock split is part of
Walmart’s ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels and its desire for its associates to
feel that purchasing shares is easily within reach. More than 400,000 associates participate in
Walmart’s Associate Stock Purchase Plan today, which allows eligible associates to buy stock
conveniently through payroll deductions and provides a 15% company match on the ﬁrst $1,800
each year.

“Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing
whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates,” said Doug McMillon,
President and CEO of Walmart. “Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a
good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.
As Sam said, ‘We’re all in this together. That’s the secret.’”

For more than 60 years, Walmart has been focused on helping people save money and live
better, including its 2.1 million associates worldwide. Walmart has focused on creating a path of
opportunity for associates by oﬀering good jobs and great careers, with continued investments
in compensation, attractive healthcare, ﬁnancial and educational beneﬁts. As part of the
beneﬁts provided to its associates, Walmart has had an Associate Stock Purchase Plan for
almost 30 years. Today’s stock split is just the latest action aimed at helping strengthen
associates’ ﬁnancial health.

The shares to be issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Friday, Feb. 23,
2024, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024.
Shareholders will receive a distribution of two additional shares of common stock for each share
held. Walmart's common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on
Monday, Feb. 26, 2024, under the company's existing trading symbol “WMT.” The stock split and
ﬁnal ratio were approved by Walmart's board.

The company expects that the stock split will increase the number of shares of Walmart’s
outstanding common stock from approximately 2.7 billion shares to approximately 8.1 billion
shares.

As a result of the stock split, proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of
Walmart's common stock underlying the company's outstanding stock awards and warrants; the
number of shares issuable under the company's equity incentive plans and other existing
agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable; the company’s common
stock dividend; and the company’s authorized buyback programs. The company anticipates
ﬁling a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the eﬀective date to
report an amendment to the company’s Restated Certiﬁcate of Incorporation eﬀecting the stock
split and reﬂecting a proportionate adjustment to the total number of authorized shares of
company common stock.
