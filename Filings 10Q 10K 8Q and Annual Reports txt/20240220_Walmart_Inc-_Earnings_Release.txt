Guidance

The following guidance reﬂects the Company’s expectations for the ﬁrst quarter and ﬁscal year 2025 and is provided on a
non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, such as the
changes in fair value of the Company’s equity and other investments. Growth rates reﬂect an adjusted basis for prior year
results. Additionally, the Company’s guidance assumes a generally stable consumer and continued pressure from its mix of
products and formats globally. The Company’s ﬁscal year guidance is based on the following FY24 ﬁgures: Net sales:
1
$642.6 billion, adjusted operating income : $27.1 billion, and adjusted EPS : $6.65.
A
On January 30, 2024, we announced our board of directors has authorized a 3-for-1 forward split of our common stock and
a proportionate increase in the number of authorized shares. As a result of the stock split, each holder of record of common
stock as of the close of business on February 22, 2024 will receive two additional shares of common stock, to be distributed
after the close of trading on February 23, 2024. For additional information, refer to our Report on Form 8-K ﬁled with the

Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs,
and it is important to review in conjunction with the company’s ﬁnancial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Walmart's deﬁnition of comparable
sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as
eCommerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs
without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales diﬀerently, limiting the
comparability of the metric.

Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
(Unaudited)

The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is
attached to the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP ﬁnancial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance
with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in
accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be
considered in conjunction with, the GAAP ﬁnancial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures in the press release may
diﬀer from similar measures used by other companies.

Constant Currency
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for
countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the eﬀect of changes in currency exchange rates as the
diﬀerence between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency
exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.

Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. When we refer to constant
currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency
amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations.

The table below reﬂects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three months and ﬁscal year ended
January 31, 2024.

Adjusted operating income

Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges included in operating
income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure to share with investors
because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, adjusted operating income aﬀords investors a view
of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings
performance as compared with that of the prior year.

When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate
ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the
eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The tables below reﬂect the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in

Free cash ﬂow

We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net
cash provided by operating activities was $35.7 billion for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2024, which represents an increase of $6.9 billion when
compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing of certain
payments and strategic inventory management as part of working capital initiatives, partially oﬀset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal
charges. Free cash ﬂow for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2024 was $15.1 billion, which represents an increase of $3.1 billion when compared to the
same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating cash ﬂows described above, partially oﬀset by an increase
of $3.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.

Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow, which measures our ability to generate
additional cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow
should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by
operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Additionally, Walmart’s deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for discretionary expenditures, due
to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business
acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash ﬂow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

Although other companies report their free cash ﬂow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash ﬂow. As a result, the method
used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash ﬂow.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow, a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we
believe to be the GAAP ﬁnancial measure most directly comparable to free cash ﬂow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities
and net cash used in ﬁnancing activities.

Adjusted EPS

Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it
excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly
comparable ﬁnancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with
investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS aﬀords investors a view of
what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings
performance with that of the prior year.

We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are
strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather
than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments.
Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to those investments.

We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three months and ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2024 by adjusting EPS for the following:

1.

unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity and other investments; and

Return on investment

We include return on assets ("ROA"), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as well as return on
investment ("ROI") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps
investors assess how eﬀectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic
initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly
comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of ROI.

ROA was 6.6 percent and 4.6 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due
to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to higher operating income. ROI was 15.0 percent and 12.7
percent for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income
primarily due to lapping opioid legal charges as well as business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, as
well as improvements in business performance, partially oﬀset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property
and equipment.

We deﬁne ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by
average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus
average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.

Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure because we calculate ROI using ﬁnancial measures that exclude and include amounts
that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP ﬁnancial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and
amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the
ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI diﬀers
from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to
exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures
how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods
exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other
companies to calculate their ROI.

Financial presentation to accompany management commentary FY24 Q4

The following guidance reﬂects the Company’s expectations for the ﬁrst quarter and ﬁscal year 2025 and is provided on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, such as the changes in fair value of the Company’s equity and other investments. Growth rates reﬂect an adjusted basis for prior year results. Additionally, the Company’s guidance assumes a generally stable consumer and continued pressure from its mix of products and formats globally. The Company’s ﬁscal year guidance is based on the following FY24 ﬁgures: Net sales: $642.6 billion, adjusted operating income1: $27.1 billion, adjusted EPS1 $6.65. Metric Q1 Consolidated net sales (cc) Increase 4.0% to 5.0%, leap year estimated to beneﬁt approximately 100bps Consolidated operating income (cc) Increase 3.0% to 4.5% Adjusted EPS $1.48 to $1.56 pre-split; $0.49 to $0.52 post-split Metric Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated net sales (cc) Increase 3.0% to 4.0% Consolidated operating income (cc) Increase 4.0% to 6.0% Interest, net Increase approximately $100M to $200M Eﬀective tax rate Approximately 25.0% to 26.0% Non-controlling interest Relatively ﬂat Adjusted EPS $6.70 to $7.12 pre-split; $2.23 to $2.37 post-split Capital expenditures Approximately 3.0% to 3.5% of net sales 1 See additional information at the end of this presentation regarding non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures cc = constant currency Guidan

Supplemental Information - FY25 and FY26 Comparable Sales 4-5-4 Reporting Calendars We report U.S. comparable sales on a 13-week and 52-week retail calendar — commonly referred to as a "4-5-4" calendar — which uses 364 days in a year. In certain years, it becomes necessary to add a 53rd week to our comparable sales reporting calendar, which will occur in ﬁscal 2025. The following tables reﬂect our period ending dates for the reporting of U.S. comparable sales throughout ﬁscal 2025 and ﬁscal 2026.

Non-GAAP measures – ROI We include return on assets ("ROA"), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as well as return on investment ("ROI") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how eﬀectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can ﬂuctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 6.6% percent and 4.6% percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to higher operating income. ROI was 15.0% and 12.7% for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income primarily due to lapping opioid legal charges as well as business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, as well as improvements in business performance, partially oﬀset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We deﬁne ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending t

include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP ﬁnancial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI diﬀers from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard ﬁnancial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 25

Non-GAAP measures – free cash ﬂow We deﬁne free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $35.7 billion for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2024, which represents an increase of $6.9 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing of certain payments and strategic inventory management as part of working capital initiatives, partially oﬀset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash ﬂow for the ﬁscal year ended January 31, 2024 was $15.1 billion, which represents an increase of $3.1 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash ﬂow is due to the increase in operating cash ﬂows described above, partially oﬀset by an increase of $3.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments requ

their free cash ﬂow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash ﬂow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash ﬂow. 28

Non-GAAP measures – constant currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the eﬀect of changes in currency exchange rates as the diﬀerence between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the eﬀects of currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The table below reﬂects the calculation of constant currency for net sales for the Walmart International segment for the trailing ﬁve quarters and operating income for the current quarter.

Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS aﬀords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to those investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three months and trailing ﬁve quarters as well as the prior year comparable periods by adjusting EPS for the relevant adjustments for each period presented.

Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin The calculation of net income (loss) margin and adjusted EBITDA margin, along with a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin to the calculation of net income (loss) margin, is as follows: Three Months Ended Q4 FY24 Q4 FY23 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 5,494 $ 6,275 Consolidated net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (184) 466 Provision for income taxes 1,840 3,093 Other (gains) and losses (813) (3,848) Interest, Net 549 507 Operating Income $ 7,254 $ 5,561 + Depreciation and Amortization 3,117 2,811 + Business reorganization and restructuring charges — 849 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,371 $ 9,221 Net Sales $ 171,914 $ 162,743 Consolidated net income margin 3.2 % 3.9 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 6.0 % 5.7 % We include net income (loss) and net income (loss) margin, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principle as well as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to provide meaningful information about our operational eﬃciency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of certain items. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We also exclude other gains and losses, which is primarily comprised of fair value adjustments on our investments which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. From time to time, we will also adjust certain items from operating income, which we believe is meaningful because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by

diﬀerences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, capital investments and other items which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. We consider net income (loss) to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of adjusted EBITDA. We consider net income (loss) margin to be the ﬁnancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable ﬁnancial measure to our calculation of adjusted EBITDA margin. Although adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are standard ﬁnancial measures, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may diﬀer from the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled measures. Net income (loss) margin was 3.2% and 3.9% for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net income margin was primarily due to higher sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 6.0% and 5.7% for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to adjusted operating income growth outpacing sales growth. 38
