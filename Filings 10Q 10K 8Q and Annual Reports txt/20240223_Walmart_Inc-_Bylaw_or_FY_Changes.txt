Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

As previously announced, on January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. (the “Company”)
authorized a 3-for-1 forward split (the “Stock Split”) of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common
Stock”), to be eﬀected through the ﬁling of a Certiﬁcate of Amendment to the Company’s Restated Certiﬁcate of
Incorporation (the “Certiﬁcate of Amendment”). The Company ﬁled the Certiﬁcate of Amendment after the close of
trading on February 23, 2024, and it became eﬀective upon acceptance of the ﬁling by the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the “Eﬀective Time”). The Certiﬁcate of Amendment eﬀected the Stock Split and also
proportionately increased the number of shares of authorized Common Stock from 11,000,000,000 to
33,000,000,000. Each holder of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on February 22, 2024 is
expected receive two additional shares of Common Stock after the close of trading on February 23, 2024. The $0.10
par value per share remains unchanged. Trading in the Common Stock is expected to commence on a split-adjusted
basis on February 26, 2024. Based on 2,684,264,089 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of February 22, 2024,
the Company calculates that there will be approximately 8,052,792,267 shares of Common Stock outstanding on
February 23, 2024, after giving eﬀect to the Stock Split, less any nominal amount of shares that may be
repurchased on such date.
