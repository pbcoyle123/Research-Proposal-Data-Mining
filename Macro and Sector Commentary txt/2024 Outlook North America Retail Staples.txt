1. 2024 Outlook: North America Retail Staples

(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- THESIS: Retail-staples companies

including Walmart, Kroger and Dollar General may face a diﬃcult
operating year in 2024 as waning inﬂation makes same-store sales

and top-line growth more diﬃcult. The key is driving higher
frequency (traﬃc) or increasing the volume of goods sold. This will

likely require more promotions, but consumer behavior still skews

to need-based purchases. We see a potential lag in that behavior
change, which may result in margin pressure, though cost-cutting,

private label and retail media could help. (12/08/23)

Food-Retailer Shares Struggle Amid High Inﬂation, Shrink

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

The BI North America food-retailer group's stock performance trailed the broader market in

January, which might extend as elevated grocery prices and concern about a recession take a toll
on consumers. Proﬁtability is being tested by wide-ranging inﬂation and inventory shrink driven by

theft. (02/06/24)

North American food retailers' performance relative to the S&P 500 this year may rely on their

ability to increase sales amid widespread inﬂation and pass costs on to consumers to avoid
substantial margin deterioration. The group declined 3% in the month of January, while the S&P

500 advanced 2.2%. Input-cost inﬂation is slowly moderating but remains above historical levels.
That, along with labor challenges and promotions to preserve market share are potential obstacles

for 2024 margins. Challenging market dynamics is also a concern with consumers prioritizing need-

based essentials over discretionary items. Retailers are responding by shifting their product mix to
lower-margin consumables. (02/06/24)

4. Grocery Retailers Pressured as Consumers Weaken

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Food retailers were likely aﬀected by an uncertain economy suppressing consumer spending.

Persistently high prices caused shoppers to prioritize essentials, leading to less traﬃc and smaller
basket sizes at grocery stores. Sentiment might have been aﬀected by expectations that retailers

would have diﬃculty maintaining near-term revenue and margin growth, as inﬂation persists and
consumers seek aﬀordable options. Grocery retailers that exceeded analyst expectations were

rewarded.

High wages and supply-chain disruptions remain margin threats. Kroger said in November it was
starting to see signs of slowing inﬂation, mainly in fresh food. The company expects the pace to

keep tapering through 2024. (02/06/24)

5. Valuations Are Muted Against Broader Market

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

How the BI North America food-retail peer group's ratio of price-to-forward earnings fares against
the S&P 500 could be determined by the level of sustained demand and margin expansion.

Proﬁtability challenges tied to elevated costs, including shrink, will likely be in focus. Peers traded

at a median 12x blended 12-month P/E as of Jan. 31, a 39% discount to the S&P 500. The peer
group's multiple is down 1.7% in January, while the benchmark increased 1.3%, suggesting

uncertainty about sectors like consumer staples with a potential recession on the horizon. (02/06/24)

Value Focus Persists

Margins Remain in Focus as Promotions Rise to Recapture Volume

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

A consumer focus on value is likely to extend through 2024, aﬀecting what, how and where they
buy goods. As inﬂation wanes, food retailers and mass merchants will need to balance price,

product mix and promotions to drive revenue growth while preserving margins. Some relief may

come from lower supply-chain and input costs. (12/08/23)

6. Inﬂation Easing, But Consumers Not Feeling it Yet

Grocery retail price growth is easing, but it may remain elevated through 1H24 as some packaged-

food companies still look to push through modest price increases. Consumers have been trading
down due to sustained inﬂation, prioritizing essentials and cutting spending on categories with

higher prices, such as beverages and some shelf-stable foods. Prices in most categories are

starting to come down, a sign that food inﬂation may have peaked and is slowly returning to norms
of low-single-digit growth. Refrigerated and frozen foods have dropped most sharply. Fresh foods,

like produce and protein, tend to be more volatile over time.

Retailers are aware of true input-cost increases due strong private-label oﬀerings and push back on

hikes they deem unwarranted. (11/14/23)

7. Transportation Costs Might Shift to Tailwind

Transportation costs are trending lower, which could provide a 1H tailwind to earnings given high
costs a year ago. Contract truck rates have come down from recent highs, but we believe they may

tick up modestly by midyear. Though average revenue per mile -- excluding the fuel surcharge for

dry-van transport -- remains elevated, the growth rate is slowing. Rail has also moderated, with

intermodal rates slowly coming down. Railroad rates are expected to rise slightly ahead of inﬂation

yet remain lower than recent highs.

Container-shipping rates between Hong Kong and Los Angeles are nearing historical norms, which

has caused retailers to abandon charter-shipping activities. We expect container rates to remain
fairly stable in 2024. (11/15/23)

8. A Shifting PPI, CPI Dynamic

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Food inﬂation may have peaked, and for the ﬁrst time since 2021, the producer price index (PPI)

has been below the consumer price index (CPI) for several consecutive months. With the PPI falling

faster than CPI, packaged-food companies may be pressured to pass through savings from lower
input costs to retailers, which then aim to transfer that to consumers. Generally, food inﬂation of 1-

3% is good for retailers, since modest price increases are easily accepted by customers and help
support top-line growth. Yet consumers have increasingly pushed back on higher-cost groceries,

shifting spending to essentials and more private-label products.

A more promotional environment is expected as retailers and packaged-food companies seek to
oﬀer value to consumers to retain loyalty and repeat purchases. (11/14/23)

9. Promotions Are Poised to Increase

The number and size of discounts and promotions could rise in 2024 as Walmart, Kroger, Target

and others attempt to prop up sales growth through volume instead of price hikes. As inﬂation
eases, we expect retailers to face same-store-sales challenges until consumers start increasing

basket size. Though deals may not reach as deep as pre-pandemic levels, they must be carefully
managed to ensure they don't squeeze margins. A race to the bottom in which retailers undercut

one another to gain customers is unlikely. Instead, personalized oﬀers are set to rise that can help

boost overall visits and spending. This targeted approach can be more beneﬁcial to margins than
widespread discounts.

10. Margin Recovery Is Tough in Value Environment

Grocery and mass-merchant retailers may ﬁnd rebuilding margins diﬃcult in 2024 as competition

for consumer spending rises. Gross margins for Kroger, Walmart, Target and Costco are below their

10-year averages. Product mix, which currently skews to more low-margin consumables and less to
highly proﬁtable discretionary items, adds pressure and seems unlikely to change soon. As food

inﬂation slowly abates, retailers will seek to pass through cost savings to customers before
bolstering margins in a bid to secure longer-term loyalty. Retailers have been eﬀective at cutting

costs and using the savings to fund initiatives that can help improve the customer experience.

Retail media networks generate high-margin marketing-derived revenue that can help mitigate
margin erosion. (12/08/23)

Keep Harnessing Eﬃciency

Productive Infrastructure Will Remain in Focus for Food Retail

Food retailers' investments in more eﬃcient infrastructure in 2024 will buﬀer against potentially

volatile demand and operating margins. Better consumption prediction and inventory-management
systems are key to providing adequate in-stock positions, while technology across the supply chain

will help curb labor expenses. (11/28/23)

11. Harnessing Eﬃciency Across the Supply Chain

More ﬂexible and eﬃcient infrastructure remains vital to withstand supply disruptions, even in a
post-pandemic world. With this in mind, food retailers are working on optimizing back-end

capabilities, a move that could support operating margins in 2024 and beyond. Better demand-
forecasting tools, particularly for long-tail items or those with low velocity, might make aisle

replenishment easier and enable improved inventory control, freeing up resources to support

online orders, along with improved in-stock positions.

Dollar General is pursuing strategies such as self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated products to

reduce the markup to third parties and expand gross margin, along with the use of shelf-ready
packaging to curb stocking costs. (11/28/23)

12. Leveraging Stores to Fulﬁll Online Orders

A plethora of consumer-staples retailers will keep leveraging their store base to fulﬁll online orders

as e-commerce penetration continues to climb. The strategy is eﬀective for those with a robust

store portfolio, as it uses them as mini-fulﬁllment centers for digital orders to ship items closer to
customers' homes. For Target, this costs about 40% less than if orders are sent from a distribution

center. Same-day order fulﬁllment costs are, on average, 90% less than if shipped from a
warehouse.

Investments to improve operations are still expected; Canadian Tire plans to invest as much as C$1

billion over the next few years to integrate its stores with its online platform to make the
experience seamless. Retailers such as Loblaw, Walmart and Petco also leverage their stores to

fulﬁll online orders. (11/28/23)

13. Leveraging Technology for Supply-Chain Eﬃciency

Greater investment in automation and other technologies will remain a focus in 2024 as retailers
aim for eﬃciencies across the supply chain, especially in distribution centers (DCs), to support

margin growth longer term. These include better purchasing, distribution, production planning and
labor allocation. Canadian grocer Metro is modernizing its distribution network to fully automate

the movement of inventory in its DCs; besides labor savings, these are 2.5x more productive than

non-automated centers. By 2025, management estimates 60% of its volume will ﬂow through
modernized DCs.

Kroger and Empire operate several Ocado-powered fulﬁllment centers with robots that pick online
orders in minutes. Canadian Tire implemented a new transportation-management system to lower

freight expenses. (11/28/23)

14. Leveraging Technology for Store Eﬃciency

Retailers' investments in technology to increase in-store eﬃciency, particularly for repetitive yet

important tasks, will continue in 2024. This enables employee time to be shifted to more value-
added tasks, improving worker motivation while lowering costs. Metro uses AI-powered tools for

fresh and grocery forecasting, along with replenishments and schedule management. Metro and

Loblaw have self-checkouts in more than 60% of their store bases. They both use electronic shelf
labels in more than 20% of their stores, which help improve pricing accuracy and reallocate labor.

Walmart uses autonomous ﬂoor cleaners that can scan aisle end-caps for low inventory levels,

while also using advanced optical technology to better sort inbound freight with fewer employees.

Retailers Battle Shrink

Rising Theft Could Cost the Retail Industry $83 Billion in 2024

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Retailers may lose $83 billion from shrink in 2024, we calculate, up 8% vs. 2022, as organized

retail crime and theft dent inventories. This may hurt margins at food retailers and mass

merchants like Kroger, Dollar Tree and Target, with the latter expecting a $500 million proﬁt hit in
ﬁscal 2023. Still, ebbing inﬂation and loss-prevention tactics may oﬀset the eﬀects in 2H. (12/05/23)

15. Shrink Losses Could Climb to $83 Billion in 2024

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Retailers' total losses from shrink continue to rise and may top $83.4 billion in 2024, based on our
analysis of total sales excluding autos and fuel. We assume the shrink rate stays at the 1.6%

National Retail Federation industry estimate. For food retailers, the pace is higher at 3%,
translating to $31.6 billion and 1.8% for mass merchants, or $18.4 billion. Inﬂation is fueling this,

as extended pressure on consumer spending boosts demand for stolen goods. Another catalyst is

current federal policies on retail theft, which only seek to prosecute if items stolen in a single

instance are worth $5,000 or more.

Though we believe that inﬂation could moderate next year, we don’t expect it to normalize until

2H. Any new legislation to deter theft may also take time. (12/05/23)

Shrink Scenario Analysis

16. Elevated Shrink Might Weigh on Retailers' Margins

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Shrink accounted for over $77.1 billion in losses for retailers in 2022, a ﬁgure that could expand
this year and remain elevated in 2024. The average shrink rate for retailers jumped 0.2% to 1.6%

in 2022 compared with 2021, according to the NRF, driven by higher organized retail-crime activity.

Retail theft accounts for two-thirds of reported shrink and sectors such as grocery, department
stores, pharmacy and mass-merchandise are more susceptible due to their wide product selections

and open-display store formats.

Companies like Target and Kroger continue to face margin pressure from shrink and expect these

issues to persist through the rest of this year and into 2024. However, industry tailwinds such as

easing supply-chain issues and lower freight rates could help alleviate some pressure. (12/05/23)

17. Shrink Is a Hot Conversation Topic for Retailers

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

The issue of shrink has become a notable discussion point, with mentions by food retailers and

mass merchants rising over 40% from last year. Companies in the BI North America food retail and
BI Mass Merchant peer groups cited the issue a total of 700 times, up from 496 in 2022. These

ﬁgures capture references to shrink in earnings calls, conferences, quarterly reports and other SEC
ﬁlings.

Target and Dollar Tree had the highest number of mentions this year compared with other retailers.

The former was forced to shutter nine stores across four states, while the latter said related costs
increased 60 bps. The rise of retail theft, along with inventory challenges stemming from a shift in

consumer-spending patterns, could weigh on retailers' margins in 2024. (12/05/23)

18. Slowing Theft by Boosting Security Measures, Using AI

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Retailers have committed to investing in security, technology and other loss-prevention tactics to
curb theft, though it may take time for these losses to dissipate. Target anticipates that shrink will

cut proﬁt by $500 million in ﬁscal 2023 and Kroger and other companies expect it to be a major

headwind. A common strategy that many retailers have deployed is locking up high-demand
products, though this may fuel adverse results and frustrate loyal customers despite companies

like Target saying otherwise.

Self-checkout, a service once lauded for its convenience and eﬃciency, has become a driver of

theft and forced retailers to leverage artiﬁcial intelligence to bolster security around kiosks.

Reducing operating hours and closing stores are other strategies being used. (12/05/23)

Food Retailers to Plow Capital Back Into Business Investment

North America food retailers will likely direct capital to investing in their businesses in 2024 to lift
revenue and proﬁt, despite reduced operating leverage, while maintaining acceptable shareholder

returns. M&A should be minimal, though we see the $25 billion Kroger-Albertsons deal (closing next

year) spurring a seismic shift in US market share. (11/28/23)

19. Food Retail Acquisitions Likely Be Sparse

M&A among North America food retailers might not be as busy as in other consumer-staples

segments in 2024 and any deals will likely skew toward smaller, complementary acquisitions. That
could mean purchases of technology to improve supply-chain capabilities, or transactions to

expand in speciﬁc locations. A limited number of targets and increased borrowing rates that could

deter debt ﬁnancing may curb the pace of deals.

Yet we expect one of the industry's biggest transactions -- Kroger’s pending $25 billion acquisition

of Albertsons -- will close in 2024. It would produce a signiﬁcant shift in food retailing, giving just
two companies -- Walmart and Kroger-Albertsons -- almost 40% of the US market. (11/28/23)

20. Operations, Investments to Pressure Cash Flow

Diminishing operating leverage and greater investment to streamline the supply chain and

improve productivity will weigh on grocery retailers' free cash ﬂow in 2024 and pressure returns.
Median capital spending for BI North America food retail peers has climbed to 2.7% of sales in the

past year (from a 10-year low of 1.7% in early 2022) on increased investment in productivity and
automation to relieve cost pressures, particularly for labor. We expect the trend will continue

through 1H.

Canadian retailer Loblaw, along with US-based Sprouts Farmers Market and Kroger, have boosted
investment from a year ago. Grocery Outlet, Natural Grocers and Weis Markets trailed their peers.

The group has failed to increase cash ﬂow from operations since 2020. (11/28/23)

21. Debt Leverage Appears Set to Increase

Investment in their businesses will likely boost debt leverage for food retail companies in 2024.
Strong cash generation at the start of the pandemic allowed them to reduce borrowing. We see

that reversing next year due to the expansion of supply-chain capabilities and ﬁrst-party data

generation to maintain healthy sales growth and proﬁtability while maintaining acceptable
shareholder returns. Ingles Markets, Albertsons and Kroger are among the companies that have

signiﬁcantly deleveraged since 1Q20. Grocery Outlet and Village Super Market are the only
retailers to have increased borrowing levels.

Median debt leverage, deﬁned as the ratio of net debt-to-adjusted Ebitda, is 2.6x for the food-retail

group, slightly below the ﬁve-year average. (11/28/23)

22. Boosting Returns Through Dividends, Buybacks

Shareholder returns in 2024 could center on supporting dividend payout ratios that remain within

historical ranges, while maintaining stock buybacks to prop up EPS growth. For the past couple of
years, the median dividend payout ratio of North America food retail companies have remained in

the 20% range, mostly in-line with the 24% ﬁve-year historical average, with Loblaw and Natural

Grocers paying higher portions of their EPS.

In the past ﬁve years, net change in capital stock has declined for the group on average,

suggesting that companies also distribute returns through buybacks, which provide greater cash-

distribution ﬂexibility than dividends. The trend was pronounced at the start of the pandemic yet
has reverted closer to the average as capital-allocation priorities shift. (11/28/23)

Private Label Outperformance

Consumers Seek Aﬀordability, Driving Solid Private-Label Growth

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Retailers' private-label products compete directly with national brands, and are accounting for a

larger share of grocery spending, according to Circana data. Walmart, Target, Kroger, Dollar

General and others see own-brands as a way to drive customer loyalty. High prices have led
consumers to try cheaper store labels that they often stick with afterward. (12/08/23)

23. Private Label Winning Over Consumers

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Private-label penetration in the US grocery category continues to expand with sales up 10.1% in
the 52 weeks ended Oct. 8, though growth has begun to slow in recent quarters, according to data

from Circana. Persistently high inﬂation and concerns about an economic downturn have been the
main catalyst, shifting consumer behavior to more cautious spending. Shoppers perceive private

label as a cost-eﬀective alternative and are willing to part with established brands to save. We

believe that this is a long-term trend that will see private label capture more market share.

24. Improvements in Quality Fuel Private-Label Penetration

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

The competitive landscape for packaged-food producers has expanded as more retailers invest in

private label. Walmart owns the two most popular brands, Great Value and Equate, and each have
a household penetration of 72% and 53.1% for the three months ended June 30, based on

Numerator Data. Kroger and Aldi were among the fastest-expanding brands, with a penetration

change of 4.5% and 1.4% for the same period.

Beyond being viewed as cheaper substitutes, improvements in quality have been key for growth.

Grocers are investing in premium packaging and functional ingredients to create products that are
superior or on par with their traditional counterparts. This has been essential in establishing store-

brand loyalty, which retailers need to retain market share after inﬂation abates. (11/14/23)

25. Retailers' Online Edge Fuel Private-Label Sales

Contributing Analysts Jibril Lawal (Consumer Staples)

Many packaged-food producers are committed to expanding their online channels, yet digital
penetration is largely dependent on food retailers like Walmart and Kroger. Beyond the limited

share of e-commerce sales generated from their direct-to-consumer websites, producers pay for

product placement and advertising on grocer's websites to fuel online purchases. This leaves
retailers with a unique advantage, as they can prioritize the promotion and sale of their in-house

oﬀerings over branded alternatives.

Walmart led all companies in online private-label sales as of March 31, boasting 42.4% as of March

31. It was followed by Kroger (11.2%), Albertsons (10.7%), Sam's Club (8.2%), and Amazon (7.3%).
