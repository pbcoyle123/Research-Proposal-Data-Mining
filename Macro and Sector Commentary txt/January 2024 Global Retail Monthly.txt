1. January 2024: Global Retail Monthly

(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- Retail media networks of Kroger, Walmart,

Target, among others could generate revenue at higher-than-expected
rates, ranging from 20-40% above 2023 levels. This year's calendar

could prove challenging for US retailers, with key holidays changing
dates, fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and

one less week for those using the National Retail Federation's calendar,

Amazon Growth Potential; Sees Big Get Bigger: BI Focus (Correct)

Contributing Analysts Poonam Goyal (Retail) & Anurag Rana (Technology)

Updating Focus Idea: Amazon.com's 4Q results fortify our thesis that its growth could extend and
that the company has potential to organically increase proﬁt, boost revenue and add share across

all its businesses. Accelerating advertising gains, gross-merchandise value and cloud momentum
through Amazon Web Services are all drivers to lift total revenue more than $730 billion through

2025 and above consensus. (Corrects to $730 billion.)

Original Thesis (January 2024): Amazon.com's growth is far from over and the web giant still has
potential to gain share organically across all its businesses, continuing to expand revenue and

operating proﬁt ahead of consensus for 2025. Advertising gains, gross merchandise value growth
and accelerating cloud momentum could drive total sales to over $730 billion in 2025, our scenario

analysis suggests, vs. consensus for $713 billion. (02/05/24)

2. Revenue Could Top $730 Billion in 2025; Ebit May Expand

Contributing Analysts Poonam Goyal (Retail) & Anurag Rana (Technology)

A rebound in cloud spending, a digital-advertising revenue ramp-up and growth across its retail

marketplace are key to Amazon's continued growth, positioning it well to surpass consensus for
2025 revenue. Our scenario analysis suggests more than $730 billion in sales for 2025, ahead of

estimates for $713 billion, led by double-digit gains in 2025 across each of its major business lines.

We also see proﬁt expanding, aided by contribution from Amazon Web Services and advertising,
with the latter making retail operating margin positive.

AWS' operating margins can return to 30%, which coupled with a 50% level in advertising, can help

drive proﬁtable growth. This could fuel Amazon's operating proﬁt to over $65 billion in 2025,
signiﬁcantly ahead of the $12 billion realized in 2022. (01/29/24)

Retailers' Calendar a Challenge to Sales; RMNs Could Lead Gains

This year's calendar could prove challenging for US retailers, with key holidays changing dates,

fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and one less week for those using the

National Retail Federation's 4-5-4 calendar, hindering sales. Retail media networks (RMN) of
Kroger, Walmart, Dollar General and Target, among others, may generate revenue at a higher-than-

expected rate. (02/01/24)

3. Earlier Easter Could Drag Sales, Shift Spending

Contributing Analysts Poonam Goyal (Retail) & Sydney Goodman (Retail)

An earlier Easter could be a headwind for retailers since shoppers might pare food, apparel, candy

and décor purchases. Cooler temperatures, less time between Valentine's Day and Easter and
fewer days of exposure to Easter merchandise are culprits. With Easter on March 31 vs. April 9 in

2023, retailers could see spending changes, since the holiday is in 1Q. Easter hasn't been in March

since 2016. For Amazon and Etsy, the eﬀect may be more mixed, as they'll see a beneﬁt to 1Q
sales, yet 2Q could be weaker. For retailers operating on a 4-5-4 retail calendar, spending would

stay in ﬁscal 1Q.

Easter is the seventh top-selling week for US retail, based on Nielsen data. Companies on a regular

calendar year have an extra day in 1Q because of the leap year. (01/09/24)

Retail media networks (RMN) of Kroger, Walmart, Dollar General and Target, among others, may

generate revenue at a higher-than-expected rate in 2024. The actual growth will likely vary by
retailer and the size of its RMN, but could range from 20-40% above 2023 levels, driven by

consumer packaged-good companies' need to increase volumes of goods sold as their ability to
raise prices wanes. This should generate higher demand for advertising and targeted-marketing

services as consumers spend cautiously.

RMNs use customer purchase data, a treasure-trove of insight, to help consumer packaged-good
companies connect with shoppers and bolster the eﬀectiveness of their marketing spending.

Retailer investments in AI can further drive media eﬃciency. (01/31/24)

Ulta, Sephora, E.L.F. Poised to Capture Rising Demand: BI Survey

Contributing Analysts Lindsay Dutch (REITs, Consumer Hardlines)

Ulta and Sephora's breadth of brands from mass-market to luxury and viral E.L.F. Beauty appear
set to take market share in 2024, our third-annual proprietary survey suggests. Consumers plan to

spend more on beauty this year, expanding the over $100 billion US market, with these specialty

retailers luring shoppers from mass merchants and drug stores with unmatched assortments,
digital capabilities and strong rewards programs. (01/26/24)

5. Digital, Specialized Beauty Channels Could Gain Share

Contributing Analysts Lindsay Dutch (REITs, Consumer Hardlines)

Ulta and Sephora trail mass merchants and Amazon.com as the top place to shop for beauty, our

survey shows, but their share may expand in 2024. Preference to shop at mass merchants, dollar

and drug stores, which don't break out pure beauty spending, weakened from a year ago, a BI
survey conducted in January found. This shift to specialized or digital channels could extend, and

favor Ulta, Sephora, brand website and social media channels. Despite an increase in shopping on

social media, it remains among the least favored platforms, even for Gen Z. That's even with 60%
of respondents (70% of Gen Z and millennials) citing social media as a leading source for discovery

-- a key driver of E.L.F.'s rapid sales gains.

We calculate Ulta's share at 9-11% of the over $100 billion US beauty market. (01/26/24)

6. Birkenstock Tempered by Weaker Proﬁt Guidance: Earnings Outlook

Contributing Analysts Abigail Gilmartin (Retail)

Post-4Q Earnings Outlook: Birkenstock's increased investment in distribution capacity and factory
improvements will reduce margin in 2024, with adjusted Ebitda margin likely to decline 240 bps.

Still, full-year sales guidance for 17-18% growth shows the brand resonating with consumers and
driving demand. We expect margin pressure to linger through 2024, yet this might unwind in 2025

as additional capacity comes online, letting the company reaccelerate margin. Inﬂation is also

hindering proﬁt, but price hikes may partially oﬀset the drag.

Sales rose 16% in 4Q, driven by 30% growth in the Americas as the brand gains momentum there,

aided by the expansion of Birkenstock's direct-to-consumer penetration. (01/18/24)

Highlights From Recent Results:

Tesco, ABF May Widen Market Share; Online Beats Signal Upswing

Contributing Analysts Tatiana Lisitsina (Retail) & Charles Allen (Retail)

Price-competitive retailers (Tesco, Sainsbury and fashion peers M&S, Primark) could reap the faster

market-share gains needed to oﬀset lower inﬂationary-sales help and rising wage costs curbing
margin. The eﬃciency focus of e-tailers' Ocado, Deliveroo and THG is driving single-digit Ebitda

beats at the latter two amid cautious growth views. (01/30/24)

Contributing Analysts Charles Allen (Retail)

THESIS: Slowing inﬂation is rendering European food retailers' key sales-growth metric more

challenging, with market-share gains required to boost mature-market revenue. More-indebted
retailers like Asda and Wm Morrison have been losing share for at least a year, which needs work

to reverse. Distressed Casino's store disposals mean it's ceding share to rival buyers. Carrefour,

Tesco and other supermarket incumbents need to consolidate share and, where possible, stop

customers switching to discount rivals with lower cost structures (Dino Polska, Jeronimo Martin), as
well as Aldi and Lidl.

Online grocery remains below pandemic highs, with Ocado paring capacity. Food-delivery peers
(Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, Deliveroo) are focusing on proﬁt, as customer loyalty faces the

test of rising delivery costs and fewer subsidies. (01/04/24)

8. Price, Assortment Ensure Future for Tesco's Large Supermarkets

Contributing Analysts Charles Allen (Retail)

Tesco is stepping up investment in its 804 large supermarkets, with an average selling area of

39,000 square feet, which may help to boost market share. The company's determination to

restore its value credentials and relevance for consumers may ensure its stores can continue to
drive sales and margin. The need to be cost-competitive with discounters has seen most company-

operated counters close and the continued advance of self-checkouts. The return of promotions,
mostly funded by suppliers, builds large supermarkets' competitive advantage compared to the

discounters that typically carry mostly private labels.

Tesco's wider assortment, including acquired brands like Paperchase, may prove more appealing to
consumers as inﬂation falls and consumers can aﬀord to stretch spending. (01/29/24)

9. Ocado Retail's Discipline Drives Ebitda Margin: Earnings Outlook

Contributing Analysts Charles Allen (Retail)

Post-4Q Trading Update Outlook: Ocado Retail's steady sales progress seems to be the result of

better operating discipline, with on-time, in-full orders up six percentage points year over year,
delivering an Ebitda proﬁt. More Marks & Spencer items were included in the assortment, while the

Tesco price-match made Ocado more competitive. Marketing spending remains constrained before

the pending change of control to M&S. This could trigger low-cost access to M&S customers and
other in-store promotions, allowing Ocado to build orders per week toward utilization of its

enlarged capacity.

Negotiations over M&S' ﬁnal payment for its 50% share in the joint venture are supposed to be

concluded but, since the payment depends on the Ebitda margin, both parties have discounted

that amount from the original £190 million. (01/16/24)

10. Deliveroo to Beat on Ebitda Yet Weak Growth Key Risk: FY Preview

Contributing Analysts Diana Gomes (Consumer Products)

Deliveroo's order losses halted in 4Q and the company expects its full-year Ebitda gain to top

guidance, aided by cost cuts and eﬃciencies. Yet management's cautious tone on the 2024 growth

outlook may challenge the company's collated consensus, which points to a high-single-digit rise in
gross transaction value through 2025. Competition in key markets such as the UK, Hong Kong and

the Middle East, and easing inﬂation, could result in a smaller lift to average order value, but might
also lessen the pressure on wallets. That, together with pricing tweaks to lure more subscription

clients, may drive order growth. Demand may stay elevated amid product expansion.

Rival Just Eat Takeaway.com is also investing in the UK, resulting in a similar near-5% rise in its UK
orders (1.6x that of Deliveroo) in Q4. (01/22/24)

11. THG Eyes 7% Ebitda Margin in 2024 on Proﬁt Focus: FY Preview

Contributing Analysts Tatiana Lisitsina (Retail) & Charles Allen (Retail)

THG's positive free-cash-ﬂow goal in 2024 is supported by a return to sales growth in 4Q, a better

Ebitda outlook and further working capital eﬃciency gains (with a £30 million inventory reduction

planned). The e-tailer could lift adjusted Ebitda margin to 7% in 2024, with further proﬁtability
gains in its Beauty and Ingenuity divisions. Beauty is set to narrow its gross-margin-led proﬁtability

gap as input costs ease, though more marketing spending may be needed to quicken sales after

Beauty customers dropped 7.6%.

New contract wins (Holland & Barrett) for Ingenuity, with a focus on larger, more-proﬁtable clients,

underpin a long-awaited turnaround. This is illustrated in two months of double-digit sales growth
after 16 months of double-digit declines as the division was exiting smaller unproﬁtable contracts.

12. 2024 Outlook: Europe Apparel Retail

Contributing Analysts Tatiana Lisitsina (Retail) & Charles Allen (Retail)

THESIS: Inditex, Primark, JD Sports and LPP aim to defy the challenges -- tough comparisons, rising
wage costs and a lackluster consumer prospects -- facing other European apparel retailers in 2024

by accelerating store investment to hasten market-share gains in the face of reduced inﬂation. It
remains to be seen if slower demand ruins their expansion plans. Zero input-cost inﬂation might

become a margin tailwind, as Next has suggested, with lower-priced retailers (Primark, Sinsay and

H&M) likely to register most relief. After trimming costs in 2023, e-commerce retailers Zalando,
Asos and Boohoo are in a leaner shape and must now ﬁnd the right balance between proﬁtability

and sales. (01/10/24)

13. M&S Restores Value to Lift Sales Beyond Margin: Earnings Outlook

Contributing Analysts Charles Allen (Retail)

Post-3Q Trading Update Outlook: Marks & Spencer's plan to revive its value credentials in Clothing

& Home is paying oﬀ after it became much less promotional, emphasizing that the ﬁrst price is the
right price. This creates a better platform for market-share gains, which likely rely on M&S

improving the relevance of its fashion to a broader consumer base. The drive in Food has been to

improve its perceived value and extend the assortment, including more ingredients and store-
cupboard items.

The 2022 decision to emphasize the rebuilding of value credentials meant proﬁts were signiﬁcantly
reduced, though they're now being rebuilt. Margins have been restored to target levels so -- with

wage costs rising -- improved proﬁt will likely have to be driven by sales. (01/11/24)

Zalando, Boohoo, THG and other e-tailers are bumping up their proﬁtability measures by excluding

stock-based compensation when compared with store-based peers, as well as Asos and Ocado,
which include it. Cash or not, these costs have an eﬀect on proﬁtability and ignoring them for some

and including them for others leads to lack of comparability. Wage costs would have been higher
without stock awards.

Though SBC was originally meant to be excluded from earnings when a start-up company didn't

generate any cash and couldn't pay employees in anything but shares, this hasn't been the case
for cash-loaded Zalando. Including SBC, Zalando would have missed its 2022 adjusted Ebit

guidance by €72.5 million. It's diﬃcult to abandon the start-up state when it means a big hit to
earnings, especially when proﬁts are low. (01/09/24)

Contributing Analysts Charles Allen (Retail)

Post-1Q Trading Update Outlook: Associated British Foods conﬁrmed expectations for proﬁt
improvement after its 16-week ﬁscal 1Q, which includes the peak retail season. Primark's gross

margin has improved, with expectations that it can remain higher even with increased freight costs

for the rest of the ﬁscal year. There is volume growth, with some additional promotional activity, in
grocery after substantial price rises were pushed through in 2023, which, with Sugar and

Ingredients, can support company-wide margin.

ABF's cash ﬂow, which is usually seasonally weaker in 1H, is supported by the continuing

normalization of retail inventory, even with quickened expansion. The share buyback of £500

million (in two equal tranches) isn't a substitute for greater capital spending (at least £1 billion) or
bolt-on acquisitions. (01/23/24)

Electronics retailers' consensus pretax proﬁt estimates for the current ﬁscal year have stabilized

following recent minor upgrades, in line with our 2024 outlook, reassuring proﬁtability can recover.
The sector continues to focus on services (repairs, replacement and credit) and cost control,

driving self-help while waiting for a more buoyant consumer, which we see unlikely before 2H.

Dunelm's lower-priced essential homeware goods and tight cost control have kept proﬁt
expectations resilient.

Travel retailers Avolta (formerly Dufry Group, includes the Autogrill merger) and WH Smith, which

had EPS and cash ﬂow boosted by high air-travel demand in 2023, could see gains restrained by
slow return of international Chinese passengers and a drag on luxury demand, particularly

aﬀecting the former. (01/25/24)

Avolta's pro forma sales forecasts imply a rise of 16-28% in 2019-27, after adjusting for Autogrill's

disposal and dollar-translation impact. Our analysis shows guidance broadly matches consensus,
yet there is low visibility on whether the company can meet its annual sales-expansion target of 5-

7% by 2026-27. We calculate 2024 sales will only be about 2% above pro forma 2019, which could

underwhelm as it may only mirror the rise in traﬃc, even though jumps in local high-street prices
(to which Avolta benchmarks) boosted reported turnover in 2022-23. Swiss Franc strength is a

headwind.

Net contract opportunities and mix-management forecasts appear light relative to peers -- such as

SSP in food and beverage -- and history, with guidance seeing them contribute up to just 1% per

annum to incremental revenue in 2025-27. (01/25/24)

Market capitalization of Anta-owned Amer Sports could exceed $11 billion if the latter reaps close

to $7 billion of revenue and widens operating margin to 15% in 2024 after its US IPO. More Chinese
consumer ﬁrms may tap overseas markets for growth, similar to PDD, Shein and Miniso, if buying

sentiment at home stays below pre-pandemic levels. (02/05/24)

18. Strong Outlook for Sportswear Growth, Margin

Contributing Analysts Trini Tan (Consumer & Technology)

Global sportswear revenue growth this year is expected to accelerate to 8% from 2023's 3%, based

on consensus estimates for the 10 largest listed ﬁrms by sales, including Nike, Adidas, VF Corp and
Lululemon. The proﬁtability of sportswear labels is also projected to expand 1.8 percentage points

this year.

Should Amer Sports perform in line with the sector and achieve about $7 billion of revenue and a
15% operating margin this year, that could power its market capitalization to exceed $11 billion,

with industry P/E at 19.7x. A successful listing of Amer before July could halve the ﬁrm's ﬁnance
costs as IPO proceeds are slated to pay oﬀ debts. (01/09/24)

19. China Growth Push Remains Intact

Contributing Analysts Trini Tan (Consumer & Technology)

Anta's 45% representation on Amer's enlarged board of directors, disclosed in the latter's Jan. 4

IPO ﬁling, raises the chance that greater China will keep driving revenue gains for the company's
52.7% subsidiary after it lists. A steady surge in Amer's greater China sales -- triple that of EMEA

and the Americas in January-September -- to 21% of revenue from 17% a year earlier may threaten
regional market share of Nike, Adidas and VF.

Amer may open more directly-owned stores for its portfolio of brands in mainland China to lift local

sales and market share through 2025. The number of Amer-operated Arc'teryx stores nearly
doubled to 63 as of Sept. 30 vs. 32 in 2019 based on available data. Amer is likely to also sell more

Arc'teryx, Salomon and Wilson merchandise via e-commerce channels in mainland China. (01/09/24)

20. Capturing Growth Opportunities Outside of China

Contributing Analysts Trini Tan (Consumer & Technology)

Consumer ﬁrms in China with an established source of overseas revenue may be better positioned

than peers to counter the risk of persistently weak buying sentiment at home and its resulting drag
on sales and proﬁt growth this year. This likely fueled the 12-month share-price outperformance for

PDD, which expanded beyond China and gained market share from Amazon last year, vs. peers.
Xiaomi and Miniso also lifted their 2024 sales growth outlook with 34-45% of receipts from abroad.

A likelihood that buying sentiment in China will stay below pre-pandemic levels may spur more

Chinese ﬁrms to go abroad this year.

Anta plans to sell namesake items in the US for the ﬁrst time in 2024, after diversifying in

Southeast Asia last year. Luckin Coﬀee recently cited plans to expand overseas after the chain's

foray into Singapore. (01/28/24)

21. PDD's Temu May Shrink User Gap With Amazon More Than Shein

Contributing Analysts Fanqianhao Zhu

Temu's monthly active users (MAUs) in 2024 could stay above Shein's if the PDD app for markets
outside China continues to oﬀer the most attractive prices for online shoppers overseas. According

to our Nov. 22 comparison of prices, shipping costs and delivery waiting time for purchases of

comparable merchandise, shopping costs were the lowest on Temu. This likely persisted through
2023 and lifted Temu's global MAU to 44% of Amazon's as at Dec. 31 vs. 4% at the beginning of

the year. Shein's user base relative to Amazon rose to 43% vs. 37% in the same period.

Alibaba will likely cede some of AliExpress's proﬁts to uphold its overseas presence amid Shein's

and Temu's price war. AliExpress may expand its oﬀering of cheaper 'Choice' deals, which lifted

orders by a double digit in the September quarter, according to Alibaba. (01/29/24)

An uptick in China's retail-sales growth over the combined months of January and February vs.

December may not be enough to dissipate the risk of lower-than-expected spending in 2024.
Spending last year was aﬀected by the lingering impact of Covid, such as shorter store operating

hours due to staﬀ shortages, which limited Lunar New Year shopping. China's December retail

sales' year-on-year growth of 7.4% vs. the consensus estimate for a 8% gain heightens the risk
that expenditure this year will rise less than the 6% expected without additional stimulus to lift

consumer sentiment in the next 11 months.

Assuming that the yearly gain in retail sales stays stable at 2019-23 levels, receipts may rise only
4% in 2024, we calculate. E-commerce ﬁrms such as Alibaba and PDD could fuel more than half of

this year's growth. (01/24/24)

23. Near-Term Distortions of Consumption Data

Contributing Analysts Trini Tan (Consumer & Technology)

Monthly read-throughs of China's consumption through March could be distorted by a low base in

2023, caused by the impact of lingering Covid fears on festive spending and weather inﬂuences.

Stronger spending on entertainment, dining, tobacco, liquor and gold jewelry this Lunar New Year
might lift year-on-year retail-sales gain for January and February above 2023's increase. Stronger

sales in these categories may oﬀset drags from reduced food stocking at home, cuts in clothing
purchases due to the mild winter and weakness in home appliances amid China's property woes.

Retailers that can make speedier product and marketing adjustments than rivals amid lackluster

consumer sentiment in China can gain market share, we believe. Anta’s competitive edge in this
respect may widen its market-share lead over Li Ning and Xtep. (01/19/24)

The persistent shift by local shoppers toward buying via e-commerce channels already lifted 2023

online receipts by 8.8% above the prior year's vs. our earlier projection of a deceleration to 5%.
This compares with a 6.7% gain in physical-store receipts. Based on our scenario of increased

promotions by e-commerce ﬁrms such as Alibaba, PDD, JD.com, ByteDance's Douyin and Kuaishou
in 2024, such online receipts might grow more than 8% to make up 32% of China's total ex-autos

retail sales.

This gain may lift advertising and fee revenue for Alibaba's Taobao Tmall Business Group, JD.com,
Meituan and PDD in 2024 from 2023's numbers. (01/18/24)

25. Global Luxury, Sportswear Retailers Sound a Note of Caution

Recent indications from Burberry, Richemont and Nike of their sales in China suggest ﬁrms may be

worried about weaker consumer sentiment after next month's Lunar New Year holidays. This fueled
cuts in the forecasts for Burberry's and Nike's revenue and proﬁt for the current ﬁscal year.

Richemont's sales in the greater China region rebounded 25% in the quarter ended December oﬀ a
low 2023 base caused by Covid-led store closures and disruptions to operating hours. The gain

may narrow sequentially in 1Q24 as more stores resumed full operating hours in the months

following Beijing's cessation of zero-Covid measures.

More evidence of retail momentum into the Lunar New Year may emerge as international ﬁrms with

a material China presence such as LVMH, Estée Lauder, L'Oreal and Kering report results in the
next three weeks. (01/19/24)

27. Apparel Sales May Stagnate on Mild Winter

Contributing Analysts Trini Tan (Consumer & Technology)

Weakness in demand for apparel in Japan -- which contributed to Fast Retailing's ﬂattish sales gains
and a 10% decline for Ryohin Keikaku vs. a year earlier on a same-store basis in January -- could

persist through February if winter temperatures stay above readings from 12 months ago. This

would hurt sales of merchandise for the season. The average temperature in Japan, which was
about 1.2 degrees Celsius higher in January than a year ago, was 0.4 degrees cooler this month

through Feb. 12, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

Apparel retailers may oﬀer more generous discounts to spur spending if sales of winter

merchandise fall below expectations. This may limit the operating-margin gains of Fast Retailing

and Ryohin Keikaku, which are both targeting higher proﬁtability for ﬁscal 2024 vs. a year earlier.
